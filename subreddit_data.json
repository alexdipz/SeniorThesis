He shot a realtor back in 2012 \"accidently\" while they were practicing \"police tactics.\" Oh, and that woman got a job working for the Sheriff later on and was caught giving lap dances to a deputy. She was suspended and the person who reported it was fired. He also pushed for an arrest warrant against a landscaper who was trying to collect a debt against one of his LT's. He sent a squad outside of his jurisdiction to hunt this guy down, and got caught by the other counties sheriff...the other sheriff called the FBI on him to ask them to investigate that. Eventually the landscaper guy turned himself in to try to fight the charge. Except, he was taken to jail, strapped to a chair so tight for for hours that they actually wounded his wrists,  stripped him, and put him in paper cloths...all because he was \"suicidal.\" What was the arrest warrant technically for? Harassing phone calls. He is well liked in his community though, he got over 60% of the vote...but this guy just smells corrupt. Good political play, I think in his community they liked how quickly he called an investigation and fired the deputy.

Which imam issued the fatwa? FGM is not something practiced in the Iraq or the region. It is mostly practiced in Sudan and Somalia and is a cultural tradition as opposed to religious in origin. Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication. Still, I am open to be corrected with verified info."

Which imam issued the fatwa? FGM is not something practiced in the Iraq or the region. It is mostly practiced in Sudan and Somalia and is a cultural tradition as opposed to religious in origin. Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication. Still, I am open to be corrected with verified info."

And the officer is only FIRED?! And people wonder why we have protests and riots in the streets over police violence, accountability, and reform. Fuck these authoritarian scumbags up the ass with broken glass."

Which imam issued the fatwa? FGM is not something practiced in the Iraq or the region. It is mostly practiced in Sudan and Somalia and is a cultural tradition as opposed to religious in origin. Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication. Still, I am open to be corrected with verified info."

Using blood donation as a way to get tested could put the blood supply at risk and endanger patients. HIV antibodies may take a few weeks to develop after infection with the virus. If you were recently infected, you might have a negative test result, yet be able to infect the recipient of your donation. That is why you must not give blood if you are at risk of getting AIDS or other infectious diseases. Individuals at risk for contracting HIV should contact their local health department for AIDS testing."

That's easy to get around.  And Rand Paul's version is worse:\n\n>FEDERAL PROHIBITION.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Federal law enforcement officer (as defined in section 115 of title 18, United States Code) may not execute a warrant until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose.\n\nShe was served with a \"no knock\" turned into a \"knock and announce\" warrant and given 30-45 seconds to respond at around 1am.  That is not enough time, and neither of these bills address that.\n\nEdit: In case people are curious how we know it lasted about a minute (my 30-45 second guess), we have two timelines, [here from the local news](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/09/23/minute-by-minute-timeline-breonna-taylor-shooting/3467112001/) and [here from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/us/breonna-taylor-police-killing.html)."

Which imam issued the fatwa? FGM is not something practiced in the Iraq or the region. It is mostly practiced in Sudan and Somalia and is a cultural tradition as opposed to religious in origin. Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication. Still, I am open to be corrected with verified info."

Using blood donation as a way to get tested could put the blood supply at risk and endanger patients. HIV antibodies may take a few weeks to develop after infection with the virus. If you were recently infected, you might have a negative test result, yet be able to infect the recipient of your donation. That is why you must not give blood if you are at risk of getting AIDS or other infectious diseases. Individuals at risk for contracting HIV should contact their local health department for AIDS testing."

Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication. Still, I am open to be corrected with verified info."

If you were recently infected, you might have a negative test result, yet be able to infect the recipient of your donation.

For example, their resistance to or dissent\ntowards the caste structure often triggers the violence.\n\nThe gang-rape and murder of two teenage girls were reported in the Katra village of Budaun\ndistrict, Uttar Pradesh on May 27, 2014. The two girls, cousins, from the Dalit Maurya\ncommunity, were kidnapped, gang-raped and hanged from a tree in Katra Sadatganj.\n\nThe girls' fault? They had asked their upper-caste employer to increase their salary by a mere\nsum of Rs 3. The upper-caste man was unable to stomach the audacity of these girls to demand\nsomething from him. This violence is not just meant to control women, but also to carefully\nmaintain the caste structure.\nSource : https://thelogicalindian.com/dalit-women-sexual-violence\n\n\nSingularly positioned at the bottom of India’s caste, class, and gender hierarchies, largely uneducated and consistently paid less than their male counterparts, Dalit women make up the majority of landless laborers and scavengers, as well as a significant percentage of the women forced into prostitution in rural areas or sold into urban brothels. (Additional: https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/india/India994-11.htm#P1985_417452)\n\nAs such, they come into greater contact with landlords and enforcement agencies than their upper-caste counterparts. Their subordinate position is exploited by those in power who carry out their attacks with impunity.\n\n\nCases documented by India's National Commission for Women, by local and national\nnongovernmental women's rights organizations, and by the press, reveal a pattern of impunity in\nattacks on women consistent with our findings. In all cases of attacks on women documented in\nthis report, the accused state and private actors escaped punishment; in most cases, attacks were\nneither investigated nor prosecuted. Until recently, the plight of Dalit women has also been\nneglected by various political movements.\n\nSource: https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/india/India994-11.htm\n\n\nOf the 33,000 rape cases recorded across the country in 2018, about 10 percent of the victims were Dalit or tribal, according to the government data, which also showed that the number of rapes of Dalit women had now risen to six a day. But these were just the reported cases; the majority (three-fourths) of Dalit women live in rural areas where many cases go unreported because alleged rapists are mostly from dominant “upper castes” and victims are invariably economically and socially weaker.\n\n“For Dalit women, there is no one to give respect or dignity,” said a lawyer, identified only as Savita,\nin a publication of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights. “I don’t agree that non- Dalit and\nDalit women are the same. Caste makes a difference.”\n\nThe conviction rate for rapes of Dalit women is under 2 percent, compared to the national\nconviction rate of 25 percent, which points to a gross imbalance in access to justice.\n\nSource: https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/rape-caste-double-standards-and-indias-middle-class/\n\n\nAdditional Links :\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/india-rape-cases-colored-by-caste-1388459896\n\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2019/may/19/four-dalit-women-are-raped-every-day-with-several-on-multiple-occasions-1978741.html\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/caste-dynamics-behind-sexual-violence-in-india/a-43732012"

Has nothing to do with Islam. I don't think they even have the medical expertise to carry this out. At the same time, ISIS is only about 3000 strong, while most of the captured territory is under local tribal control who have thrown support to ISIS against the Iraqi government. Lastly, if coming via Kurdish sources, this may well be propaganda to discredit ISIS. The hysteria around this reminds me of when Saddam was thought to be about to nuke America, total fabrication.

All im saying with these numbers is that 32,000 extra voters are plenty to sway an election either way and that's important. Whoever is president next year will be the president of everyone; rich, poor, black white, man, women, lawyer, teacher, police officer, doctor, drug dealer, convict, and used car salesman.

Screw them, they cowered and bowed to King Donald far too long. D straight down the ticket...done with these clowns. Restore the GOP to a semblance of morals again, kick out every single clown in congress, and maybe they will one day get my vote again.\n\nEDIT: WOW! I honestly am shocked on the support here. I want to respond to everyone but it's becoming a real project,  so I'll just respond to what I'm hearing most. \n\n1. Many are asking, what I saw moral about the GOP before Trump. Honestly, I start to question this myself more every day. In the past, I really wasn't paying attention, and nobody around me was telling me any different. It was a microcosm, and I was part of it. My thinking most of my life was \"get through college\" \"get married\" \"have kids\"...elections for me, didn't get nearly enough thought. And honestly,  I wasnt challenged enough, being surrounded almost completely by Republicans. That's my fault. I'm seeing things that make me stand up and say \"hold up...\"  so,  for the many asking (and a few being downright mean about it): I voted for this party,  who I now see has caused a good amount of damage over the decades, I voted for them because I was duped into thinking they truly stood for things important to me. Things like family values, and faith in God...led me to think it was simply a no brainers and cast my vote simply as a duty to the country,  and that's the most I thought about it for a long time. I've many regrets in life, and this attitude is one of them.\n\n2. No, I'm not really a democrat pretending to have switched to create a false narrative,  this type of comment is one of the many reasons I've walked away from the Right. \n\n3. I have NEVER been okay with bigotry, racism and misogyny,  and honestly it's been through this process of introspection that was thrust upon me due to the severity of the situation, that I saw just how much hatred towards LBGTQ and Women that members of the GOP have been responsible for.  Truth be told, I've felt quite the opposite for my entire life, at least as far back as I can remember.   I may be a demon to those of you who are angry that I voted the way I did for so long. All I can say, is I was ignorant and I regret it, and it wasn't for the reasons some of you want to attribute.  \n\n4. For everyone else: you guys have honestly helped so much just with all the encouraging comments! I live in the same dang area I grew up in, full of the same closed minded people I grew up with. My wife and I are ostracized from church gatherings,  family, and friends as one of the very few in our neck of the woods without a trump sign in the yard.  Thank you all who totally forgive me for making I'll informed choices while being distracted by...life. and those of you saying \"me too, same here \" Vote!!! The tide IS changing, thanks to you all for making this trip of growth,  and swallowing that pride...to progress to better choices so we can help fix this mess."

I’ve appeared on CNN, MSNBC, and I have a growing [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDB5XReUyyqt-FTNdkzFN-A) where I yell into the computer about my thoughts on Clinton, Bernie, Trump, email servers, and 2016. I also have two self-published [novels](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/h-goodman/breaking-the-devils-heart/) that are hopefully going to be picked up very soon (it’s looking good) by a big publisher. Overall, I’ve enjoyed helping destroy the lesser evil voting philosophy, although it’s still alive. Looking forward to this AMA\n\n[Proof!](http://imgur.com/umnMyQ8) \n\nwww.hagoodman.com \n\nH.A.

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

As ABC News noted of those documents:\n\n**In fact, it appears that Pelosi uses military aircraft less often than her predecessor, former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.**\n\nThe documents cover the period from January 2007 to November 2008 and show that Pelosi made the equivalent of 20 round-trips between Washington (Andrews Air Force Base) and San Francisco. That's an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft. Like Hastert, Pelosi also occasionally leads Congressional delegations on foreign trips (the documents show six foreign trips: one to Asia, three to the Middle East and two to Europe). "

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

This is all normalization, expect events like this to continue well into the future especially if Trump is re-elected. He will turn the white house into a 24/7 campaign for himself, his kids, and whatever else he wants to promote. \n\nI know there's so many things you can say \"If Obama did it\" about the Trump administration, maybe that's their idea. They just want us to be completely worn out and not pay attention to the destruction of normalcy and principles and the promotion of blatant corruption in the executive branch. It's all so disgusting. You just fucking know if Obama had done ANYTHING remotely like what this Republican convention has become, the numerous hatch act violations, using the White House as a prop for a political convention, the heads of the same GOP senators, congressmen, spokesmen and other sycophants that spoke at the RNC would have exploded with the force of a nuclear bomb."

That's an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft. Like Hastert, Pelosi also occasionally leads Congressional delegations on foreign trips (the documents show six foreign trips: one to Asia, three to the Middle East and two to Europe). "

The three officers fired a total of 32 shots in Taylor's apartment, according to investigators.\n\n\"The whole damn system is guilty as hell,\" demonstrators in Milwaukee chanted as they marched down Interstate 94, temporarily blocking traffic.

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

That's an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft. Like Hastert, Pelosi also occasionally leads Congressional delegations on foreign trips (the documents show six foreign trips: one to Asia, three to the Middle East and two to Europe). "

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

This is all normalization, expect events like this to continue well into the future especially if Trump is re-elected. He will turn the white house into a 24/7 campaign for himself, his kids, and whatever else he wants to promote. \n\nI know there's so many things you can say \"If Obama did it\" about the Trump administration, maybe that's their idea. They just want us to be completely worn out and not pay attention to the destruction of normalcy and principles and the promotion of blatant corruption in the executive branch. It's all so disgusting. You just fucking know if Obama had done ANYTHING remotely like what this Republican convention has become, the numerous hatch act violations, using the White House as a prop for a political convention, the heads of the same GOP senators, congressmen, spokesmen and other sycophants that spoke at the RNC would have exploded with the force of a nuclear bomb."

In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft.

The majority begrudgingly accepted the 2016 election results, but I am extremely doubtful they will again if Donald Trump loses the popular vote.\n\nHow I see November playing out is the following three events:\n\n• Trump loses the popular vote but wins the electoral college\n\n• Trump performs an attempted coup by preventing mail in ballots from being counted after election night.\n\n• Trump performs an attempted coup by declaring himself winner with false claims of rampant election fraud.\n\nWe all need to prepare for an attempted coup or another attempt at minority rule and determine that we won't stand for it. We can do this peacefully using whatever leverage we have. Democracy is written with ink and not in stone, the people can change the rules if there's enough of us."

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

This is all normalization, expect events like this to continue well into the future especially if Trump is re-elected. He will turn the white house into a 24/7 campaign for himself, his kids, and whatever else he wants to promote. \n\nI know there's so many things you can say \"If Obama did it\" about the Trump administration, maybe that's their idea. They just want us to be completely worn out and not pay attention to the destruction of normalcy and principles and the promotion of blatant corruption in the executive branch. It's all so disgusting. You just fucking know if Obama had done ANYTHING remotely like what this Republican convention has become, the numerous hatch act violations, using the White House as a prop for a political convention, the heads of the same GOP senators, congressmen, spokesmen and other sycophants that spoke at the RNC would have exploded with the force of a nuclear bomb."

In your \"Who Cares If Russia Leaks Clinton's Emails\" article, you seem to argue that the US should not come to the defense of a hypothetical country that Russia invades. Given that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are the only NATO members that are in possible danger of being invaded by Russia, are you agreeing with Donald Trump's earlier statement that we don't need to abide by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?\n2. You seem to disagree with the use of military force against Bashar Al-Assad. In your opinion, what is the proper response to someone using chemical weapons against a civilian population?\n3. You rarely seem to comment on Donald Trump's positions on Muslims. Do you think that these positions don't matter with regard to international relations, or do you just not care about that part of this election?\n4. Is there any copy editing process before your articles are published?\n5. I've noticed a shift in your articles towards including youtube links rather than making arguments in the articles themselves. Is there a reason for this?"

They just want us to be completely worn out and not pay attention to the destruction of normalcy and principles and the promotion of blatant corruption in the executive branch. It's all so disgusting. You just fucking know if Obama had done ANYTHING remotely like what this Republican convention has become, the numerous hatch act violations, using the White House as a prop for a political convention, the heads of the same GOP senators, congressmen, spokesmen and other sycophants that spoke at the RNC would have exploded with the force of a nuclear bomb."

As ABC News noted of those documents:\n\n**In fact, it appears that Pelosi uses military aircraft less often than her predecessor, former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.**\n\nThe documents cover the period from January 2007 to November 2008 and show that Pelosi made the equivalent of 20 round-trips between Washington (Andrews Air Force Base) and San Francisco. That's an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft. Like Hastert, Pelosi also occasionally leads Congressional delegations on foreign trips (the documents show six foreign trips: one to Asia, three to the Middle East and two to Europe). "

A bid for an extradition treaty that would have allowed him to eventually be moved to mainland China and then to the courts in Taiwan (since the alleged murder occurred in Taiwan) failed as a result of the HK protests, resulting in the alleged murderer walking free.\n\n>Chan Tong-kai, who killed his girlfriend Poon in Taiwan before fleeing back to Hong Kong, walked free since last October and has yet to turn himself in. “I don’t see any benefits our intervention can bring,” she added.\n\nI remember this guy promising to turn himself over to Taiwan after legally having to be freed since he was held for too long without charge.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame. Even more I am saddened by the fact they are supported by 11% of our population. But at the same time, lying is not the way to fight them. More drastic measures need to be taken to eradicate racism from our country..\n"

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.\n\n- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.\n\n- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.\n\n- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.\n\n- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.\n\n- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.\n\n \nIf you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair \"use sticky\" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.\n \n**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**\n\n* **The July 13/14 Sticky [can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/)**\n\n\n- We appreciate any feedback sent to us via [replies to this moderator comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/cixpxz2) or modmail and will consider it when reviewing the experiment.

            "selftext": "There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe World News Team.  \n\n***\n***\n\n**Resources**\n\n**[Previous Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3qd2ek/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[Second Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pwi22/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[First Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pjow7/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_palestine/)** \n\n**[IDF Live Blog](https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2015/10/19/live-updates-terror-strikes-israel/)** | **[IDF Twitter](https://twitter.com/IDFSpokesperson)** ||| **[PMG Daily Reports](http://www.nad-plo.org/dailyreports.php)** | **[Ma'an News Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaanNewsAgency?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)**\n\n***\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n*11/07/15 Incidents*\n\n* [IDF arrests Palestinian who shot soldier near Hebron](http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-arrests-palestinian-who-shot-soldier-near-hebron/)\n\n* [Young woman lightly injured by stones in riots near Rachel's Tomb](http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Young-woman-lightly-injured-by-stones-in-riots-near-Rachels-Tomb-432332)\n\n* [Video from vehicular incident in Hebron leaked online, shows the 72-year-old Palestinian suspect was not trying to harm IDF soldiers and was in fact executed, according to Palestinian reports.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl)**)\n\n*11/08/15 Incidents*\n\n* [Five Israelis wounded in vehicular terror attack in West Bank (Tapuah junction)](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Three-people-wounded-in-vehicular-terror-attack-in-West-Bank-432368) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwspafl)**)\n\n* [A security guard was lightly injured in a stabbing attack at the entrance to Beitar Illit, near Gush Etzion.](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203070#.Vj8UnGQrIb0) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsqcrt)**)\n\n* [48-year-old man wounded seriously in stabbing near Alfei Menashe](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203077#.Vj8292QrIb0)\n\n* [Rocket explodes in open area in Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Rocket-siren-alarms-in-Shaar-HaNegev-Regional-Council-432411)\n\n* [Border policeman wounded in terror attack succumbs to wounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b)**)\n\n* [Israel Terrorizes Hebron Residents.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame. Even more I am saddened by the fact they are supported by 11% of our population. But at the same time, lying is not the way to fight them. More drastic measures need to be taken to eradicate racism from our country..\n"

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.\n\n- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.\n\n- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.\n\n- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.\n\n- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.\n\n- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.\n\n \nIf you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair \"use sticky\" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.\n \n**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**\n\n* **The July 13/14 Sticky [can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/)**\n\n\n- We appreciate any feedback sent to us via [replies to this moderator comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/cixpxz2) or modmail and will consider it when reviewing the experiment.

If that's the case, the payer must hire you as employee.  You cannot be freelance while having a full time contract with a single business. In the ruling it was said that riders are working with Glovo (a single company), which is who is setting the conditions, and not with every individual customer.\n\n\\-To be a frellance worker your should own (or at least be in control of) your means of work. If you depend of your payer assets, then you are dependent of that company and they must hire you as employee. In this case, Glovo is the owner of the means of work, and sets the conditions to use them. Glovo also had the power to deny riders the hability to keep working at all.\n\n\\-Glovo forced specific schedules on many riders (to make sure they had enough working at all times), and favoured with their algorithm those working full time over the rest. Implicitly Glovo was forcing it to be a full time job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be freelance workers, riders should have had the ability to work directly with the clients (business and/or customers). They should work with more than one. They should be able to negotiate their own tariffs and conditions. They should own their equipment. They should have the ability to continue doing their job with a different client if their current client decides to cut ties with them. That was is the case with Glovo (or Uber, or many other).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck Glovo, and let's keep \"gig economy\" as far away from us as possible."

Former employees of Cambridge Analytica and SCL moved to successor firms, these companies dissolved with acquisition by holding company Emerdata Limited. The company now appears to be largely owned by Rebekah Mercer and Jennifer Mercer according to Cambridge Analytica's bankruptcy filing in New York. Cambridge Analytica was before partially owned by their family, including their father Robert Mercer, a computer scientist who made contributions to brown clustering. In July 2018 the Emerdata director was Jacquelyn James-Varga. The Federal Trade Commission of the United States has imposed to sue Cambridge Analytica after misusing data scraped from 87 million unwitting social media users. The company was soon acquired by Emerdata Limited after the news on misappropriation of digital assets was publicized.[1]\n\nActivities\n>The internal administrators (during the David Carroll case) of Emerdata Limited have been accused of misleading an adjudicator according to the High Court of England and Wales. Adjudicator Robert Hildyard, who had earlier granted Cambridge Analytica legal motion to be put into administration, \"wasn't told\" that administrators of High Court (Vincent Green and Mark Newman of liquidator Crowe LLP) were, allegedly, not \"independent\" of Cambridge Analytica.[2] \n\n>The High Court of Justice of England and Wales affirms Emerdata’s subsidiaries or daughter companies are the SCL Group Ltd and SCL Analytics Ltd. The trading subsidiaries of SCL Analytics Ltd are SCL Commercial Limited which provided data analysis to commercial customers, SCL Social Limited which provided campaign management and communications services to political customers, and SCL Elections Limited. *In April 2019, 21% of Emerdata's shares were held by three individuals, **Alexander Nix**, Julian Wheatland and Nigel Oakes. Julian Wheatland is now its sole director.*[3][4]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerdata_Limited\n\nedited formatting"

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads.

Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.

            "selftext": "There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame.

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> The barrister who was mistaken for a defendant three times in one day at court has called for compulsory anti-racism training at every level of the UK legal system.\n\n> Wilson has called for lawyers and the court system to introduce far more ambitious anti-racism training that actively tackles discrimination in the legal profession.\n\n> &quot;If a barrister is treated like that, you wonder how a defendant&#039;s going to be treated, and whether the defendant is going to be treated fairly. There needs to be more and better training.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe World News Team.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads.

Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame. Even more I am saddened by the fact they are supported by 11% of our population. But at the same time, lying is not the way to fight them. More drastic measures need to be taken to eradicate racism from our country..\n"

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.\n\n- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.\n\n- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.\n\n- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.\n\n- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.\n\n- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.\n\n \nIf you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair \"use sticky\" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.\n \n**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**\n\n* **The July 13/14 Sticky [can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/)**\n\n\n- We appreciate any feedback sent to us via [replies to this moderator comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/cixpxz2) or modmail and will consider it when reviewing the experiment.

In fact, the last immigration vote was won by 50.3%. it wasn't that long go either - 2014 I believe.\n\nThe reason so few issues are decided by large margins is that political parties in CH are fairly balanced across the spectrum and many people tend to vote along party lines. Both sides are allowed to make their points, and swiss voters are generally quite well educated politically. They take these referendums seriously. This usually results in both sides of any contentious issue getting a solid base (say 35-40% each).\n\nThen the rest of the voters (the ones who were undecided or the ones not faithful to their party) make up the numbers (the remaining 20-30%). These tend to be roughly evenly split too, so most referendums, unless they are pretty unimportant or not contentious, end up with a relatively small winning margin.\n\nThe SVP are notoriously anti immigration, and there are a few parties who align with them on this. But, to go from 50.3% to 35% in 6 years means that people are very quickly losing faith in the SVP and the other right wing parties. Older voters (the SVPs bedrock, and usually overrepresented in referendums) are dying off, and new voters simply aren't attracted to SVP policies. Immigration votes like this one provide a good way to measure the success (or lack thereof) of the SVP political machine.\n\nThis is the surest sign yet that the SVP is losing it once-firm grip on swiss politics. Immigration votes are usually very close (as the last one proved) but for there to be as wide a gulf as this is very unusual.\n\nThe SVP could go back to square 1, start collecting more signatures and force another referendum in 6 years, but in reality, people are getting fed up of a one-track party. They have no real alternative to offer people, and many of their policies are obsolete or lacking. They seem old, stodgy, and a product of a bygone generation. Add to that that people are now getting bored of their one-track messaging - 'immigrants & EU bad' - and it suggests a deep shift in swiss politics."

This conflict was brought to a halt by Soviet Expansion, and in 1922 when the two were formally admitted into the Union the region and surrounding territories were announced by Stalin, as Commissar for Nationalities, to be under the control of Azerbaijan. The objections of ethnic Armenians living in the region lead to the creation of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1923.\n\nDuring the Soviet Period the dispute remained dormant, but re-emerged during the collapse of the USSR and the independence of the Caucasus States. The Armenians within the Autonomous Oblast declared independence with the intent of reunifying with Armenia, leading to the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988 to 1994), which resulted in a ceasefire and nominal independence for Artsakh.\n\nThe war lead to a large number of displaced peoples, with approximately half a million displaced people of Azerbaijani Origin, and approximately three hundred thousand displaced people of Armenian origin.\n\nSince then, the situation has remained stable, though occasional border clashes have occurred as Azerbaijan seeks to regain control of the region.\n\n##Further Reading (Wikipedia)\n* [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia)\n* [Armenia-Turkey Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Turkey_relations)\n* [Armenia-Russia Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Russia_relations)\n* [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan)\n* [Azerbaijan-Turkey Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan%E2%80%93Turkey_relations)\n* [Azerbaijan-Russia Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan%E2%80%93Russia_relations)\n* [Nagorno-Karabakh War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War)\n* [Republic of Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh)\n   \n   \n^^Feel ^^free ^^to ^^copy ^^and ^^paste ^^me ^^where ^^relevant"

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.

Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.

            "selftext": "There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe World News Team.  \n\n***\n***\n\n**Resources**\n\n**[Previous Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3qd2ek/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[Second Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pwi22/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[First Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pjow7/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_palestine/)** \n\n**[IDF Live Blog](https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2015/10/19/live-updates-terror-strikes-israel/)** | **[IDF Twitter](https://twitter.com/IDFSpokesperson)** ||| **[PMG Daily Reports](http://www.nad-plo.org/dailyreports.php)** | **[Ma'an News Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaanNewsAgency?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)**\n\n***\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n*11/07/15 Incidents*\n\n* [IDF arrests Palestinian who shot soldier near Hebron](http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-arrests-palestinian-who-shot-soldier-near-hebron/)\n\n* [Young woman lightly injured by stones in riots near Rachel's Tomb](http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Young-woman-lightly-injured-by-stones-in-riots-near-Rachels-Tomb-432332)\n\n* [Video from vehicular incident in Hebron leaked online, shows the 72-year-old Palestinian suspect was not trying to harm IDF soldiers and was in fact executed, according to Palestinian reports.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl)**)\n\n*11/08/15 Incidents*\n\n* [Five Israelis wounded in vehicular terror attack in West Bank (Tapuah junction)](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Three-people-wounded-in-vehicular-terror-attack-in-West-Bank-432368) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwspafl)**)\n\n* [A security guard was lightly injured in a stabbing attack at the entrance to Beitar Illit, near Gush Etzion.](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203070#.Vj8UnGQrIb0) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsqcrt)**)\n\n* [48-year-old man wounded seriously in stabbing near Alfei Menashe](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203077#.Vj8292QrIb0)\n\n* [Rocket explodes in open area in Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Rocket-siren-alarms-in-Shaar-HaNegev-Regional-Council-432411)\n\n* [Border policeman wounded in terror attack succumbs to wounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b)**)\n\n* [Israel Terrorizes Hebron Residents.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame. Even more I am saddened by the fact they are supported by 11% of our population. But at the same time, lying is not the way to fight them. More drastic measures need to be taken to eradicate racism from our country..\n"

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.\n\n- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.\n\n- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.\n\n- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.\n\n- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.\n\n- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.\n\n \nIf you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair \"use sticky\" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.\n \n**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**\n\n* **The July 13/14 Sticky [can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/)**\n\n\n- We appreciate any feedback sent to us via [replies to this moderator comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/cixpxz2) or modmail and will consider it when reviewing the experiment.

No respect accorded to the victim or her family. Then the district magistrate was caught on camera issuing thinly veiled threats to the father of the victim, the administration tried to declare the whole village as a covid zone to stop other political party leaders to come and visit and a member of the victim's household - an young boy had to hid from the cops and run through fields to come and tell the ordeal to journalists as to how they are being threatened and their mobiles have been taken away. Along with this, the there was a meeting held in the village supporting the accused. UP government has also hired a PR agency to change the narrative.

            "selftext": "There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \n\nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe World News Team.  \n\n***\n***\n\n**Resources**\n\n**[Previous Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3qd2ek/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[Second Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pwi22/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_palestinian/)** | **[First Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pjow7/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_palestine/)** \n\n**[IDF Live Blog](https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2015/10/19/live-updates-terror-strikes-israel/)** | **[IDF Twitter](https://twitter.com/IDFSpokesperson)** ||| **[PMG Daily Reports](http://www.nad-plo.org/dailyreports.php)** | **[Ma'an News Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaanNewsAgency?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)**\n\n***\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n*11/07/15 Incidents*\n\n* [IDF arrests Palestinian who shot soldier near Hebron](http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-arrests-palestinian-who-shot-soldier-near-hebron/)\n\n* [Young woman lightly injured by stones in riots near Rachel's Tomb](http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Young-woman-lightly-injured-by-stones-in-riots-near-Rachels-Tomb-432332)\n\n* [Video from vehicular incident in Hebron leaked online, shows the 72-year-old Palestinian suspect was not trying to harm IDF soldiers and was in fact executed, according to Palestinian reports.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsajyl)**)\n\n*11/08/15 Incidents*\n\n* [Five Israelis wounded in vehicular terror attack in West Bank (Tapuah junction)](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Three-people-wounded-in-vehicular-terror-attack-in-West-Bank-432368) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwspafl)**)\n\n* [A security guard was lightly injured in a stabbing attack at the entrance to Beitar Illit, near Gush Etzion.](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203070#.Vj8UnGQrIb0) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwsqcrt)**)\n\n* [48-year-old man wounded seriously in stabbing near Alfei Menashe](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/203077#.Vj8292QrIb0)\n\n* [Rocket explodes in open area in Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Rocket-siren-alarms-in-Shaar-HaNegev-Regional-Council-432411)\n\n* [Border policeman wounded in terror attack succumbs to wounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b) (discussion comment **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/cwt5z7b)**)\n\n* [Israel Terrorizes Hebron Residents.

Nuclear waste, particularly HLW, gives off small amounts of hydrogen over time. Typically, this is mitigated through pumping air into the header of every process tank and running that gas through an offgas filtering system (bubbling through water, HEPA, etc). However, if an air compressor breaks down or a pipe gets clogged, its possible to get a dangerous buildup of hydrogen, and not necessarily in a tank with waste. Even if a process tank exploded, it would probably be in a \"black cell\" (room built to contain radiation, usually made with 5' thick concrete walls). Things might suck for employees and cleanup crews, but its unlikely to have any widespread impact."

Any other greek in this thread can confirm this by reading the transcripts found [here](http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%ABheil-hitler%C2%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE)\n\nAgain, as a Greek living abroad I am saddened every day i hear about the golden dawn and the terrible things they say without any shame. Even more I am saddened by the fact they are supported by 11% of our population. But at the same time, lying is not the way to fight them. More drastic measures need to be taken to eradicate racism from our country..\n"

            "selftext": "This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. \n\nYesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.\n\nThere are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. \n\nSo now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.\n\nFor those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:\n\n1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.\n\n2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.\n\n3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.\n\n\n\n### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**\n\n- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.\n\n- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.\n\n- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.\n\n- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.\n\n- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.\n\n- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.\n\n \nIf you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair \"use sticky\" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.\n \n**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**\n\n* **The July 13/14 Sticky [can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/)**\n\n\n- We appreciate any feedback sent to us via [replies to this moderator comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/cixpxz2) or modmail and will consider it when reviewing the experiment.
