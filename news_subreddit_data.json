The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of 0.00007%.\n\n* There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)\n\n* Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail."

The opinion was 6-3, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Breyer. Kavanugh, Alito, and Thomas dissented.\n\nAs of today, the Supreme Court puts being gay or transgender in the same category as being black when it comes to employment discrimination. You cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being black and you cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being gay or trans.\n\nHere are the opening two paragraphs. They explain everything you need to know:\n\n>Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected consequences. Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In\nour time, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII,\nCongress outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Today,\nwe must decide whether an employer can fire someone\nsimply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer\nis clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different\nsex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the\ndecision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\n\n>Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have\nanticipated their work would lead to this particular result.\nLikely, they weren’t thinking about many of the Act’s consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis\nof motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male\nemployees. But the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest. Only\nthe written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to\nits benefit."

People were shaking hands, not wearing masks and walking in large groups. This was on a video that was posted in their own Facebook group.\n\n\nI commented on the video, saying something like \"Looks like a lot of people not distancing and not wearing masks. We don't want a hotspot here in Raleigh.\"\n\nWithin literally sixty seconds I couldn't view the video anymore because I'd been banned from the group because I suggested taking safe precautions for protesting.\n\nBasically, no wonder she contracted it. Half the people at that protest probably did. And then we're going to have to use resources to save their lives.\n\nI think those people should protest under the agreement that if they contract COVID 19 they have to refuse medical treatment. Since it's a hoax, of course.\n\nEdit: [Here's a video of the protests.](https://youtu.be/ucYXXL2GTbc)"

I think we all know the insurance companies aren't going to just eat the extra cost, so I guess they'll just be raising general rates for all policy holders in Virginia to offset it?\n\nPlease note that I'm not necessarily criticizing the new Virginia law here.  My wife and sister are both insulin-dependent diabetics so I'm acutely aware of the problem, and I'm inclined to place the lion's share of the blame on the pharma manufacturers.

They broke in, plain clothes, shot the dog, shot the couple, shot each other, and claimed that the old guy that they killed managed to shoot 5 of them with a revolver vs all of them with guns blazing. The union president (and current national FOP vice president, Joe Gamaldi) went on to say:\n\n\"Enough is enough. And if you're the ones that are out there spreading the rhetoric that police officers are the enemy, just know, we've all got your number now. We're going to be keeping track of all ya'll, and we're going to make sure that we hold you accountable every time you stir the pot on our police officers.\" \n\nOther Houston police union officials have tweeted things such as that the couple are \"still dirtbags\" even after the fabricated warrant came to light (and untagged drugs were found in the lead officers car, used to plant). \n\nThe officer most responsible for the raid had a 34 year career, with hundreds of cases now under review, and several overturned after it came to light he has made arrests and got convictions for years on completely fabricated evidence (as well as pocketing money for fake informants). He has since been charged with murder of the couple in the Harding street raid. \n\nSo when you think about how bad no knock raids are, just remember, some of the top officials of the national fraternal order of police not only support them, they actively threaten anyone that speaks against such tactics (or really anything that isn't licking police officers boots). Since the DA has pressed charges against the officers, the local union has become increasingly vocal about \"activist DAs\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecan_Park_raid"

David H. Berger said in a letter dated Monday and addressed to his fellow Marines. “But I am also mindful of the feelings of pain and rejection of those who inherited the cultural memory and present effects of the scourge of slavery in our country.”\n\nThe intent behind the ban was not to judge the meaning that individual Marines ascribe to the symbol, he said, but rather to help build “a uniquely capable warfighting team whose members come from all walks of life.”\n\nThe flag has the “power to inflame feelings of division,” he said, adding, “I cannot have that division inside our Corps.”\n\nAll Marine Corps installations have regulations prohibiting the display of symbols related to hate speech, guidelines that General Berger said were intended to foster an environment that promotes unity and security.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nHe ended his letter by asking Marines to focus on the symbols that unite them: the eagle, globe and anchor.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the ban would apply to clothing and cars owned by Marines when they are off base and off duty. The Marine Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came two months after General Berger ordered the removal of all Confederate paraphernalia from Marine Corps installations, according to CNN.\n\nIt was one of several directives, some of which he announced on Twitter, for “immediate execution.” Among them were revisions of the corps’s paternal leave policy and its enlistment policy, to disqualify applicants with a domestic violence conviction.\n\nGeneral Berger’s announcement follows years of national debate over the removal of Confederate flags and monuments from parks, public squares and college campuses across the South.\n\nIn June 2015, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina ordered that the Confederate battle flag be permanently lowered from the grounds of the State House after decades of political battles.\n\nFour years later, Ms. Haley was criticized after she told a conservative radio host that the flag had symbolized “service, sacrifice and heritage” for some people in the state until Dylann S. Roof, who fatally shot nine African-American churchgoers in a racially motivated rampage in Charleston in 2015, “hijacked” it.\n\nStatues and other monuments symbolizing the Old South have also been the subject of intense debate.\n\nIn November, a Confederate monument in Pittsboro, N.C., was removed from outside a courthouse where it had stood for 112 years, following months of what the chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners described as “high emotions, division and even violence.” Some cities have even gone so far as to auction off their Confederate statues."

If he had cashed in other options he'd purchased, his lawyers said, he may have even made a profit. \n\n> \"The information they gave him was just incredibly skewed. And possibly completely wrong, because they make it look like you owe $730,000 when you really don't owe anything\" said Benjamin Blakeman, one of the Kearns family attorneys. \"That could panic just about anybody.\"\n\nSo, this kid didn't owe them any money.  Robinhood was essentially his broker, and  I suspect that a broker misinforming their client would have damning consequences."

It’s about population reduction because there are too many people on the planet\n\nOh, he's also a climate change denier. Not because he denies the science behind it, but he believes it's a globalist plot used to curtail people's freedom and reduce the population.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Howard-Browne#Allegation_of_plot_to_attack_Donald_Trump\n\n> In March 2016, Howard-Browne wrote a Facebook post titled “Donald Trump Is the New World Order’s Worst Nightmare,” where he detailed his choice to back Trump in the election as a check against a global conspiracy to destroy America.[35]\n\nThis isn't just one guy. He's holding megachurches that I assume aren't exactly empty."

The lies and suspicious activity already confirmed tells me that they cannot be trusted.\n\nThe nearly-blank reports.

When you are so bad, or unobservant, or careless that someone gets killed, that's manslaughter or negligent homicide  for the rest of us.

Not caring they were endangering innocent people in the process?\n\nNow this. That's a lotta stupid bullets. There's them either not knowing about or lying about the body cam.\n\nI mean, come on. There's no universe where this is anything but an utter disgrace. The lies alone. The disregard for people's lives and privacy and dignity and rights. And there's still people acting like the people who complain about this treatment and want to change it are the bad guys.\n\nAs if black people, and all people, in this country have no right to bitch about this, and protest, and march. As if this stuff, that goes on constantly - and we all know it except the willfully ignorant - is okay?\n\nAll lives matter just as much. That means when you let black lives matter this little, your life is diminished to the same small value, even if you don't know it yet. Breonna today, anyone tomorrow.\n\nMake no mistake, the people of color, including blacks and indigenous people, have been getting shafted first and worst. And even if you're lucky enough not to be one of the victims today, you should stand up for those who are. You should do that because it is right. But if you can't do it for that reason alone, do it because tomorrow it's you and yours shot in bed or under that heel. Or your kids.\n\nBreonna Taylor's life had real value. She worked hard to become a person who could help others. Faced all manner of challenges, starting with being born a color that gets extra problems dumped on you. She deserved better.\n\nAnd we should giver her, and everyone like her, and everyone at all, including ourselves, better. Value each other more than the cops who busted down her door and murdered her did.\n\nPeople acting like there is any excuse for her death at the hands of these men, like people who shout out against it, who defend these criminal cops. It disgusts me. It saddens me. How can anyone pick that side?\n\nI'm sorry. These cops are the bad guys. They are the villains of this piece.

Data storage is dirt cheap even for terabytes of info. If it’s boring footage for most, good, I hope it is. And if the fail safe worked and did turn the cameras on, we wouldn’t have the current problems, would we?!

I’d love to give my tax returns\". Obama's birth certificate was released a week later, resulting in Trump saying his tax returns would be released \"at the appropriate time\".\n\nIn 2012, Trump implored for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's tax returns to be released on April 1, which \"historically is the time that everybody gives them\". That year, Trump also said that not seeing a presidential candidate's tax returns would lead people to think there was \"almost, like, something wrong. What's wrong?\"\n\nIn May 2014, Trump said in an interview: \"If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that.\"\n\nIn February 2015, Trump said that if he ran for the presidency: \"I would release tax returns\". On another occasion that month, he declared: \"I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns\".\n\nIn January 2016, Trump was asked by Chuck Todd if he would release his tax returns, to which Trump answered: \"we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely. [...] at the appropriate time, you'll be very satisfied.\" In February 2016, Trump said that he would release his tax returns \"[p]robably over the next few months. They’re being worked on now.\"\n\nHe's been talking about showing his returns for 22 years now, yet when the courts get involved to hold trump to his own word, he says he'll fight it and calls it a witch hunt or fishing expedition."

Not many states have actual ballot precincts open early except for the election day (California being one of them)."

That starts a process which includes research by the prosecutor and defense and sharing any evidence either side plans to use at trial. Sometimes, based on that research (or occasionally external factors), the prosecutor no longer thinks the charges are appropriate/worth pursuing, so they _drop_ them -- that is, they tell the court they won't pursue that part of their complaint any longer. A judge doesn't make that call. A judge _can_ make a ruling that the complaint doesn't meet the legal criteria for the court to consider it, which is the judge _dimissing_ the case.\n\nProsecutors have broad discretion about what they choose to charge. Judges do not -- they can't just dismiss a case without a legally-solid reason. In this case, the Judge dismissed the case because the prosecution was unable or unwilling to supply necessary evidence to the defense (with a strong implication that said evidence doesn't exist or was being deliberately hidden or destroyed).\n\n**tl;dr** prosecutors _drop_, Judges _dismiss_."

                    "text": "> Two days after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, Jackson Reffitt’s father, Guy W. Reffitt, returned to the family’s home in Texas. He told his son that he had stormed the Capitol, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\n> Then his father leveled a threat: If Jackson, 18, reported him to the police, he would have no choice but to do his “duty” for his country and “do what he had to do.”\n\n> In interviews with investigators, Jackson Reffitt said his father told him: “If you turn me in, you’re a traitor. And you know what happens to traitors. Traitors get shot.”\n\n> But he had already reported his father to the FBI weeks before the riot.\n\n> “He would always tell me that he’s going to do something big,” Jackson Reffitt said in a phone interview Saturday. “I assumed he was going to do something big, and I didn’t know what.”\n\n> Guy Reffitt’s wife told investigators after the riot that he was a member of the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group, according to the affidavit.\n\n> FBI agents found an AR-15 rifle and a pistol at his home. Guy Reffitt told investigators that he had brought the pistol with him to Washington.\n\n> Jackson Reffitt said he learned that his father was headed to Washington the day before the riot but that he did not know what he would be doing there. He discovered what was happening when he saw images of rioters storming the Capitol on the news.\n\n> It was not clear what, if anything, the FBI did after Jackson Reffitt first contacted them about his father. Federal investigators contacted him during the riots to follow up on his tip from weeks earlier, at which point, he said, he helped “prove what they were trying to investigate.”\n\n> Jackson Reffitt said he had “just wanted someone to know” about his father’s threats of “doing something big.”\n\n> “I didn’t know what he was going to do, so I just did anything possible just to be on the safe side,” he added.\n\n> Guy Reffitt, who was arrested Jan. 16, faces charges of obstruction of justice and of knowingly entering a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. He could not be reached Sunday, and it was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer. The FBI was not immediately available for comment Sunday.\n\n> Jackson Reffitt said he was unsure if his father knew yet that he had reported him to federal authorities.\n\n> “I am afraid for him to know,” he said. “Not for my life or anything, but for what he might think.” But he said he was hopeful that his relationship with his father could be repaired.\n\n> “We’ll get better over time,” he said. “I know we will.”\n\n> He said his mother and two sisters “had no idea what I had done” until they saw a CNN interview he did with Chris Cuomo.\n\n> After the interview gained traction online, Jackson Reffitt said on Twitter, “Yes I’m the kid on cnn.”\n\n> The tweet garnered thousands of likes and retweets, and he said he was flooded with messages asking him to set up a GoFundMe, so he did.\n\n> “Every penny is another course in college or me saving it for years to come,” he wrote on the crowdfunding platform. “I might be kicked out of my house due to my involvement in my dad’s case, so every cent might help me survive.”\n\n> Jackson Reffitt was not staying at his family’s home, and he declined to say where he was for fear of his safety. He was using his girlfriend’s phone because his family had disconnected his, he said.\nHe said he posted the GoFundMe page shortly before going to bed Friday, expecting a few thousand dollars would be raised. When he woke up Saturday, the page had raised more than $20,000.\n\n> As of Sunday afternoon, more than 1,800 donations were pledged, amounting to more than $58,000.\n\n> Jackson Reffitt is in his first semester studying political science at Collin College, a community college near his family’s home in Wylie, Texas, a Dallas suburb. When asked if the money would cover the rest of his undergraduate education, he said: “Oh man, you have no idea. I’m going to go on to a university now.”\n\n> As for others grappling with whether to come forward about someone they believe could be involved in something dangerous, “you’re not just protecting yourself, but you’re protecting them as well,” he said.\n\n> “I put my emotions behind me to do what I thought was right,” Jackson Reffitt said of reporting his father. And though he does not regret his decision, he said, “He’s still family, and it’s still weird.”\n\nTL:DR as provided by /u/Kangheh4533:\n\nDad threatens son with getting shot if he told the FBI on him, Son said “fuck that” and called em weeks before"

On May 4, the Miami Herald called the department to make a statement about their upcoming story that the virus was circulating in the community in January, months before Florida announced its first case. This story was published on May 5. However, on the evening of May 4, they [stripped the relevant piece of data](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20200505/coronavirus-florida-patients-in-florida-had-symptoms-as-early-as-january) from their website. The Tampa Bay Times began asking for that missing data, and Jones was asked to disable exporting of the data, she barely pushed back, but ultimately complied. They then told her to re-enable it which she did, and the data re-appeared. They then stripped her office of the ability to manage the dashboard and ultimately fired her around 2 weeks later over that time, the data in the dashboard was [increasingly restricted](https://cbs12.com/news/local/woman-who-designed-floridas-covid-19-dashboard-has-been-removed-from-her-position) and data was disappearing.\n\nSo, essentially, she put data on the dashboard that showed Florida had cases earlier than they had reported, a newpaper picked up on it and published it, they selectively deleted that data and asked her to turn off access to the data which she pushed back on, and they re-posted the data once reporters began asking where it went. They then stripped her department from running the dashboard, fired her, and then began deleting more data and restricting access to the database.\n\nI guarantee you that multiple newspapers have made public record requests to get all of their e-mails, and the story will probably get a lot more damning once they get them."

He also briefly considers Amazon's treatment of its workers before the pandemic:\n\n>And at the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response. It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.\nAmazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward. Don’t say it can’t be done, because France is doing it."

Today was bad. 8am-11:45am: boats of all sizes, a lot pushing weight capacity, full speed heading east from every boat launch they could get to in hopes they don’t miss the people planned to skydive from helicopters. This made the lake as choppy as it gets in bad storms. 11:45am-12:10pm: the calm before the storm. 12:10pm-12:30pm the large fast cigarette boats and cabin cruisers go by. Their combined wakes rock our marina. Boats tied off on the docks closest to the lake move back and forth in there slips harder than I’ve seen in the worst storms. Dock lines are snapping continuously as we retie them, and it’s hard to keep balance as the whole marina rocks up and down. 12:30pm the smaller boats arrive en mass. Hundreds of boats plowing through the water because they are going too slowly to get up on plane. This seemed to amplify the choppy water more than the large boats. It is important to note that at this point the fast boats had now reached the parade’s turn around point and began traveling back through the slower boats. There are no right of way laws on lake traffic so it turned into an absolute cluster fuck at this point. People began taking shelter in any cove, dock, marina they could. People began filtering into the boat launch by my work looking either defeated or pale with fear. All the partying, music, and flag waving was over. Every one of them with a story about how that was the most dangerous thing they had done in their life. I just nod thinking, “that’s the second most dangerous thing they’ve done.”\n\nEdit:spelling, times"

I'm Canadian for reference but come from a latin-american family, look Italian and don't speak English with an accent.\n\nIt was 2018 and I was in Denver on a work trip for a semi-annual conference. I brought my drone with me to capture the event from the sky and take some pictures. \n\nWanting to be safe, and ensure I could fly it with out issue, I approached a group of policemen on horses  who were in the park in front of the capital building and asked one of them if it was legal to fly my drone in Denver.\n\nHe looked a little like a stereotypical cop you'd see in a movie. Big white guy, dark aviator sunglasses, rust coloured duster mustache that covered his top lip. He looked down at me from his horse and gave me a short dismissive response. \n\n\"You can try, see what happens\" he responded to me. This caught me by surprise as I was looking for a yes or no answer or for him to explain that its illegal or that its fine to do. \n\n\"Uh I see\" I replied,  thinking that if I gave him context it would help get an answer, \"I have this event and I need to know if I can -\" \n\nHe cut me off, \"there was a guy out here last week, I sat here and watched him unpack his drone get it started up and the moment I saw it leave the ground I gave him a ticket. Does that answer your question?\" \n\n\"OH, you didn't give him a warning or anything?\" \n\n\"Thats not my job,\" he responded to me, \"I don't sit in front of stop signs and tell people they need to stop; I wait for them to not stop and then pull them over. Thats how I see it\". \n\nThis encounter totally changed the way I view American cops. It fed into every power hungry stereotype I've ever heard and really just left me with a sour taste in my mouth."

Jones and others on his InfoWars conspiracy news site **have portrayed the mass shooting as a hoax.**\n\n> Heslin’s lawsuit contends that a June 2017 report by InfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer — **which claimed that Heslin could not have held his dead son in his arms as he has said — was based on a deceptively edited interview with a medical examiner** and was intended to buttress the InfoWars narrative that the mass shooting was not what it appeared to be.

Also, since when is a moving violation an arrestable offense? The Chief needs to discuss the entire interaction and whether each action was legal. Pulling him over for an offense is legal. Asking him to get out for a moving violation seems unlikely to be standard procedure. Attempting to arrest someone for filming is not likely legal, depending on circumstances. Then you have the pepper spraying, and the refusal of a towel.\n\nI'd like to know how many inproper things the officer did. If it was as many as I think, demotion alone is probably not sufficient here."

Wouldn't surprise me if other statues like that were constructed in a similar way.\n\nEdit: for those who want to hear it from the horse’s mouth: [heres an interview with the sculptor](https://whyy.org/articles/on-furor-over-rizzo-statue-sculptor-zenos-frudakis-says-qlets-talk-about-itq/) \n\n>When I put that sculpture in, I put it in to be there permanently. You’d have to break up a good part of that stairway. That stone would have to be hammered to bits. Normally, you’d have a granite base, and you’d drill holes, and have probably seven inches coming out of each leg going into the ground, and an epoxy. But, with this one, we’ve got a bronze base that’s welded to it that we had to put it in because there’s a subway station underneath. It’s installed in a way that would make it very difficult not to damage the sculpture, the steps, and everything around it."

Two of the charges, vehicular homicide and vehicular assault, are felonies, a spokesman for the prosecuting attorney’s office said.\n\nThe Washington State Patrol and F.B.I. were still investigating the matter, and Mr. Kelete could face additional charges, according to [a statement](https://twitter.com/KCProsecutor/status/1280991043014373377) from the prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe authorities said that Mr. Kelete was driving a white Jaguar XJL when he drove into the protesters “at a high rate of speed” early on Saturday morning, striking two protesters.\n\nOne of them, Summer Taylor, 24, of Seattle, died later that day at the hospital. Another protester, Diaz Love, 32, of Portland, Ore., was hospitalized in serious condition.\n\nA sobriety test indicated that Mr. Kelete was not under the influence at the time, according to a police report.\n\nDiaz Love, who, like Summer Taylor, uses nonbinary pronouns, shared a hospital selfie on Facebook this week with a message saying that they were “alive and stable.”\n\n“I cannot believe Summer was murdered,” they wrote. “If they thought this murder would make us back down. They are very wrong. Very wrong.”\n\nThe episode followed [dozens of similar incidents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/bloomington-car-attack-protesters.html) involving cars striking demonstrators at protests against racism and police brutality, which have taken place across the country in the weeks since George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.\n\nIt was not always clear which incidents were premeditated and which were prompted by rage as drivers found their routes blocked by protesters.\n\nMr. Kelete’s lawyer, John Henry Browne, told [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/767ccce98285f8ab8f7312dc769462e5) that Mr. Kelete was “remorseful” over the incident and that “there’s absolutely nothing political about this case whatsoever.”\n\nMr. Kelete lives with his parents in Seattle, Mr. Browne said.\n\n“I don’t know what happened, but I’m very sorry,” Mr. Kelete’s father, Tekie Kelete, told [KOMO-TV](https://komonews.com/news/local/driver-accused-in-i-5-crash-that-killed-protester-injured-second-due-in-court). “I’m very sorry to the girl, her family. It’s very sad.”\n\nMr. Browne did not respond to a request for comment."

                    "text": "For those who are getting the paywall:\n\nBody-worn camera footage from former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane, who is charged with killing George Floyd, showed that Floyd was given no explanation for why he was being questioned before Lane pointed a gun at him, swore at him, physically touched him multiple times and forced him out of his vehicle into the street.\n\nThe court made footage captured by Lane and former colleague J. Alexander Kueng publicly viewable Wednesday by appointment. Sixty-six spaces were made available at one-hour increments to watch the videos that totaled about an hour and five minutes long.\n\nThe Star Tribune was able to view about 30 minutes of Lane’s video and the first few minutes of Kueng’s video at the time of this article’s online publication.\n\nLane’s video also showed that medics who arrived at the scene did not appear alarmed or rushed in assisting Floyd after taking his pulse, and that about three minutes passed before anyone began performing CPR on Floyd, who had been unresponsive for several minutes by then.\n\nLane’s attorney, Earl Gray, filed the two videos in court last week along with a motion to dismiss the charges against his client, whom he has argued was a rookie working at the direction of 19-year veteran, Derek Chauvin.\n\nLane twice asked about flipping Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, from his stomach onto his side after Floyd complained multiple times that he couldn’t breathe, and later boarded an ambulance and performed CPR on Floyd, Gray has argued.\n\nBut Lane’s bodycam video showed that as the first officer to engage with Floyd on May 25, he did not inform Floyd that he was being investigated for allegedly using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods before he pointed a gun at him, swore at him multiple times while Floyd repeatedly said “please” and asked what was going on, reached his hands into Floyd’s car and touched him several times and forced Floyd out of the vehicle.\n\n“I didn’t do nothing,” Floyd said about two minutes into the video, holding his left hand visibly up in the air as he sat in the driver’s seat.\n\n“Put your [expletive] hands up right now!” Lane yelled while aiming a gun in his right hand at Floyd. “Let me see your other hand.”\n\nLane and his partner, Kueng, were the first to arrive at the Cup Foods on Chicago Avenue and E. 38th St. and encounter Floyd and his two companions sitting in minivan parked nearby. Kueng assisted Lane in handcuffing Floyd.\n\nChauvin and his partner, Tou Thao, arrived later to assist.\n\nAbout 11 minutes into Lane’s video, Lane grabbed Floyd’s leg and helped Chauvin and Kueng flip Floyd from his back onto his stomach in the street.\n\nThe bodycam video and video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly 8 minutes while he said he couldn’t breathe, called out for his “mama” several times and warned the officers he was going to die. Bystanders also pleaded with the officers and yelled for them to stop.\n\nKueng knelt on Floyd’s back while Lane held onto his legs. Thao managed bystanders at the scene and dismissed their concerns.\n\nLane’s video showed that he asked twice about rolling Floyd onto his side, but did not appear to express any sense of urgency, fear or persistence in his voice.\n\nAn ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after Lane first arrived at the scene and spoke to a store manager, who was seen in Kueng’s video carrying an apparent gun tucked into the waistband of his shorts.\n\nA first responder took Floyd’s pulse at his neck and walked away without a sense of urgency. Ambulance staff loaded Floyd into the ambulance. Lane boarded the ambulance as well.\n\nAbout three minutes after the ambulance first arrived at the scene, Lane began performing CPR on Floyd at the instruction of a first responder.\n\nChauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree murder, third-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter. The other three are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter."

According to the Encyclopedia of Alabama, he was jailed on treason charges in New York City before returning South after the war, and was later prohibited by U.S. authorities from taking office as an elected judge in Mobile.*\n\n> *He devoted his later years to writing his memoirs and became a “Lost Cause” hero to Southerners who lamented the end of the Confederacy. The statue was dedicated in 1900, the year before Alabama ratified a Constitution that established white supremacy in the state by essentially disenfranchising blacks and poor whites.*\n\nYeah, sounds to me like having a statue celebrating him for 120 years was a bit of a White-Power Move. I'm glad he's gone\n\nThere are better ways to remember history than by blatantly celebrating the traitorous racists"

This will greatly reduce smoke damage.  \n* If you can, self evacuate early.  I do not want to see any of my Oregon friends stuck in traffic.  I encourage you to follow your gut and go when you say you feel unsafe.  \n* Keep a cooler of non perishable drinks and snacks in your car.  We had to drive to another state to find somewhere that would take doggos and was kid friendly. - Withdraw a bit of cash to keep on you.  I forgot to notify my bank and I had a fraud alert placed on my cards.  \n* When you get back home, do not sweep or blow the ash.  This can create a toxic air quality and can blow hot embers.  Instead use a hose to wet down the ash and wet paper towels.  \n* When you get back home, replace all filters in your home and car- An easy way to rid your home of the smoke smell is to attach large filters to box fans, cover with a wet towel doused in fabric softner and let them run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Above ALL else, I hope my Oregon friends and family are safe.  **My last bit of advice is to take it easy on yourself.  You're in the middle of a global pandemic, your home and community is on fire.  It is ok to have hard days, to grieve for your loss and your community and just the general situation of the dumpster fire that is 2020.  Allow yourself to cry, get angry, drink a glass of wine, or smoke a joint.  Its ok to not be ok and to feel unsafe right now. \u0003**\n\nEdit- Formatting I hope this helps and my apologies that it took so long to get on my computer to edit the comment properly"

The officers involved gave a fishy story to a bunch of people who didn't believe them. Now there is a Federal Civil Rights case going on which is what is likely requiring the state to make the camera footage available to the family. The officer in question was fired last month and likely killed himself in a single car crash.\n\nEdit2: After thinking on this for a little, that federal suit was likely why he was fired in the first place rather than the police wanting to do the right thing."

I'm on the DTCI side of things (Disney+ and international offerings) and even though D+ has been doing alright given everyone's at home watching tv, there are still engineers and business admin getting laid off. Lost half my team last week to it.\n\nEdit: For those looking for more info. I work building a tool to produce highlevel operational analytics for VPs and above. I am an FTE and about 90% of my team are/were contractors.\n\nEdit2: I may or may not agree that Disney is an evil company as everyone has been saying. But I do have to say that since I've been at Disney, the company has treated me very well. And the people that I've worked with at Disney have been some of the most genuine people I've ever met my entire life"

They said that is already an expectation for most law enforcement agencies in the state but putting it into law would allow officers who fail to step in to face criminal prosecution.\n\nWhat the what now? The police union is asking the state to make it a crime for officers to sit on the sidelines when excess force is used? I never heard of a union asking for *more* regulation, particularly with criminal consequences."

Apparently she's not listed on the website and most people are denying it or not commenting.\n\n\n\"Interpol said it did not confirm red notices other than those listed on its website. Sacoolas was not listed publicly.\"\n\n\n\"Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service did not confirm the ITV report but said in a statement that it still wanted Sacoolas to stand trial in Britain over last August’s crash.\"\n\nThis sounds contradictory, and I'd rather wait for an official statement to take it as fact."

As a dentist, I'm told every day that I cannot do treatment for a patient because someone without a dental degree working for the insurance company is dictating the patients treatment based on whether or not the insurance company will make or lose money. It's absolutely mind boggling how doctors have not unionized and taken back control of healthcare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you guys may say, \"Well dentists and doctors are just greedy\". Well go ahead and look at the increase in income for dentists and doctors over the last 20 years. The average income is actually going DOWN, while the debt load and cost of training is rising due to tuition. This makes becoming a doctor less attractive for society. In contrast, look at the stock of UHC in the last 20 years. Over a 4,000% fucking increase! The CEO of Cigna gets paid over $43 million fucking dollars in direct compensation. Fuck for profit insurance companies. They have no place in healthcare."

All this stuff about his military experience, law enforcement work and top secret work with the FBI is being poured out by his attorney in an effort to convince the judge he’s trustworthy enough to drop bail.  He’s a known Oath Keepers leader but now he’s in court denying everything and the fact that he’s with the Oath Keepers.\n\nHere’s a little snippet-\n\n***Authorities say the Oath Keepers communicated during the attack about where lawmakers were. At one point during the siege, Caldwell received a message that said “all members are in the tunnels under the capital,” according to court documents. “Seal them in turn on gas,” it said.***\n\nKeep rooting these mofos out and keep them locked up.  Show them and their ilk that their ~~way of thinking~~ willingness to take baseless action to violently force their beliefs upon others is not welcome in America.\n\n\nPs:  “Seal them in, turn on the gas” - Some Nazi at Auschwitz, probably.\n\nEDITED: while on the subject of Nazis, I thought I’d share an interesting fact I bet a lot of folks don’t know that blew my mind the first time I learned it- Over *1,000* concentration camps of some sort were built throughout the course of WWII.  Most folks know only about the main 10-20 camps.   That’s it.  A simple fact.  Not excusing or forgetting concentration camps run by other regimes around the world at any given time.  Here’s another fun fact:  Chairman Mao killed upwards of 80 million people (possibly more) during his Great Leap Forward campaign.  More than Hitler and Stalin *combined*.  Bonus fact:  tens of thousands (on record, upwards of 20k) of Stalin’s numbers were *literally* personally delivered by the hands of his favorite executioner for 30 years (and BFF, btw), Vasily Blokhin.  Here’s just one small example to back that up:  \n\n***Starting in April 1940, after the sun went down, the process started. A Polish officer was led to the “Leninist room”, painted red, where he was identified and handcuffed. Guards then restrained him and took him next door to the execution chamber. Its walls were padded, the floor sloped toward a drain; a hose was available. Waiting inside was Vasili Blokhin, decked out in a leather butcher's apron, a leather hat and large leather gloves. Without comment or formality, Blokhin put his pistol at the base of the prisoner's skull and shot him once. Blokhin's men then removed the body through another door to the waiting trucks. Then the process restarted with the next prisoner and the next, until the night's quota of 250 Poles were all dead and gone. With the night's work done, Blokhin provided vodka for all his men. This went on for for ten hours a night for 28 nights.***\n\nAnd Stalin took all the credit.  What a dick.  Seriously, fuck him in particular."

By we sorted it out quickly and everyone voted properly.\n\nEdit: Another thing that drove us nuts were the families that had apostrophes in their last names. One family had a situation where one used the apostrophe, one didn't, and one used the apostrophe but put a space after it. That was fun (not!).\n\nFor anyone who may be worrying about voter fraud or have criticisms about how poll workers do their jobs, try actually working an election as a poll worker. You'll learn pretty darn fast that voter fraud is next to impossible as it's usually clerical error, see the apostrophe fun above. \n\nAnd you'll find out even faster that when you've got 500 hundred people coming into the precinct to vote in just under 6 hours and you only have 6 poll workers, 1 Judge of Elections, 1 poll book, 4 voting machines and 1 ballot box, being fast and accurate is the name of the game. If that means telling everyone exactly what they need to do over and over and over (sign your legal name here, go there, put the ballot in this way, walk over to that machine) then that's what you do to keep things moving.\n\nWe had close to 750 voters over the whole day and less than 10 had actual issues that we couldn't figure out and had to call the county for help. One of the best experiences I've had volunteering and I'll be volunteering again for as many future elections that I can."

A fight broke out and they killed him.  \n\nGiuliani released this guy's juvenile record to the public to show he was \"no altar boy\".  Apparently if you ain't an altar boy (most boys aren't), you deserve to die.  \n\nAs sickening as that move was, it worked.  The officer who shot him was never charged.  The family got a settlement, but they never got justice.  Because that's how it works for regular, everyday people--especially black people.  You can be an upstanding citizen and the cops can roll up on you and kill you, then drag your reputation in the mud before you're even buried in the ground.  And then the person leading it all can be held up as America's Mayor the following year and go on to be best buds with and personal lawyer for the worst president the US has ever had."

Feel free to ask for some kind of specific photo as proof, and AMA. I am really hurt about all of this, because I was one of the citizens that got taken advantage of. Hopefully the water bill will go down now that I’m not paying for these people’s fishing trips :(\n\nI live in this town (temporarily in town while I’m restoring a little farmhouse just outside of it.) the rumors of this have been circulating for years. They still had a lot of support from townspeople. I get that it’s hard to believe someone that smiles, and says hi to you every morning at Casey’s can do something like this. However things have been sketch for YEARS. Here’s some juice:\n\nThe mayor told people that lived on the golf course road that they would personally have to pay extra for road repairs bc there was no money.\n\nThe town water is SHIT. The well on my farm has way better water. Despite this the water bill is like $180 a month. This is the same cost as a nearby town of 10k people that just built a new treatment plant. Ours is ancient.\n\nThe mayor owns a car wash. Said car wash had a broken water meter on it for years, and did not pay a water bill. One of the chiropractors in town built a “fuck you” car wash as close as he could to it to steal business. Doc’s new car wash is so much better, the mayor ended up having to sell his, but nobody will buy it. [Here is a photo of the mayors pedo van locked in his carwash the night he got arrested. There is police tape in front of the door.](https://imgur.com/a/UPz8sK5)\n\nThe mayors road was the nicest paved street in the town by far. It was not a busy road at all.\n\nRandom, but the mayor won $90K in the lottery a month ago. He actually did according to the lottery office, and it was not embezzlement money.\n\nThe mayor lives in a pretty plain house. Nothing fancy at all.\n\nThe town cop is the mayors brother (EDIT: son not brother) in law. He is also one of the highest paid town cops in Iowa.\n\nThe cop deployed his TASER at someone during a party in exchange for money. The person he zapped with it asked him too to see how it feels. When Craig asked for another shock cube thingy (sorry idk what they’re called) the police department make him fill out paperwork, and the truth came out.\n\nThere have been questions as to their political positions in here. I know the mayor and town cop are conservative. Idk about the other two.\n\nThat’s just some of it. I hope the town can begin to heal now. I’m just really sad for my little community. I can think of so many big things that $100K could do for a little town like this, and it’s too bad that we have to miss out on that. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything, and I’ll do my best to answer."

Yet push back our date to get the vaccine, and if we get Covid, we have to use our own personal and sick time. On top of this, right now 25% of our staff are out with Covid, and merging classes. So they are increasing our risk of getting it or spreading it, but then won't help us financially when we do get it. So basically its \"you are super important, but if you get Covid, fuck you\"."

She was adopted in the 40s around the age of ~~4~~ 7, by this wealthy couple. She was orphaned dued to the Nazi who perished her family. Our village is the birthplace of her adopted ~~father~~ grandfather. She continues to honor him with these gifts to the children. \"A little gift by Madame Noelle\", was the only clue on the little tag. Only my 5th year living here I bothered to look up who she was.\n\nWe also have a pretty nice cultural theatre built here, renovated from the structure of an ancient synagogue. This was a courtesy of her and her husband, the latter which the center is named after.\n\nPeople don't talk about it much, these wars, as life trickles onward, but the history are all around, with these stories and monuments, the remnances of major heartbreaks as well as some triumphs.\n\n\n\nEdit to correct and add : The lady has her own english [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9one-No%C3%ABlle_Meyer). She was adopted at the age of 7.\n\nAs I'm not a native here, with language barrier, I may have not known names right away, like her grandfather's. I don't think there is any direct descendants still living in our actual village.\n\nHere's [the chocolate](http://imgur.com/gallery/x6orev0) with a card my kids bring home from school every December 6, on St. Nicolas day."

The city is working on securing more shelter space to accommodate more people but as it stands it is difficult when a couple of shelters in the area had to close due to the outbreak and many others are not taking in any new intakes to prevent spread. That being said the city, housing commission and local providers are working on plans to get as many off the streets long enough to try and mitigate the spread and get people the care and services they still need\n\nEdit: wow this blew up, thanks to those who understand that regardless of your situation we are all in this together. And for those of you with more questions, I'm sorry to say I dont have all the answers but if you are in need of service I would recommend 211 as they can direct you based on area, level of need etc. And lastly for those of you who are concerned about issues with the homeless and what they will do etc, I ask that you understand that we are all human beings and all suffer one way or another and all need help from time to time, even if we make mistakes that doesnt mean we should turn our backs to anyone, especially now more than ever in this awful crisis."

All I can say is this plan is going to be an absolute shitshow without constant police presence on-site. \n\nWhen we worked with FEMA, it was housing refugees from cities that were virtually destroyed by a hurricane. Over 100 rooms for 3 months solid and we still nearly lost money from how hard these people trashed the place over the course of their stay. In addition to wildly unreasonable demands and constantly talking shit about how horrible Dallas was (despite the fact that the city was going out of its way to be a safe haven for them), here are some of the highlights:\n\n- One family had a pit bull on a leash tied to their doorknob and left it out in the hallway all night, which posed a danger to at least that entire floor, if not the whole hotel. \n\n- A family let their kids roam without supervision and one of them took off their diaper & smeared shit all over the walls and carpet. \n\n- Multiple families tried to sneak in goddamn *monkeys*.\n\n- One guy got high as fuck and KO'd a Papa John's delivery man who was delivering pizza *to him*. \n\nThis kind of stuff was rampant for months. We had to shut down multiple whole floors for weeks at a time to do repairs after they left.\n\nAnd all of this was done by people who had homes and jobs and are generally functioning in civilized society. So I honestly shudder to think what is going to happen to these L.A. hotels when they fill up with hundreds of people who *haven't* functioned in society for a long time, because they give even less of a shit than the FEMA refugees and are often even more violent & aggressive. Without a literally *constant* police presence on every floor for the duration of this program to prevent violence and also to keep these people from going out and interacting with randoms for drugs, sex, etc., I can't see this turning out well at all. The intentions are certainly good, but there's a huge chance that all this will do is let the government know exactly where the next COVID-19 epicenters are gonna be."

I used to volunteer with kids aging out of the juvenile system during their probation.\n\nSeveral of them, who denied being in gangs, said that cops regularly used this strategy: of falsely labeling people as \"known gang members\" because that would make their lives difficult every time they were stopped and make it easier for police to justify putting them back into the system.\n\nI interacted with enough cops during that time to sense that there was probably some truth to what they were saying.\n\nEDIT: Wow. Would not have expected this to be my most upvoted comment. For what it's worth, volunteering with these kids opened my eyes to how sheltered, privileged and naive my worldview about crime, politics, poverty and justice really were. It was the most profound experience and completely changed the course of my life. If you think poverty or criminality are black and white... that justice can be boiled down to \"the authorities are the good guys and the criminals are the bad guys\": You are wrong."

I told them they needed a credit card this time and she got all pissy with me telling me that she would go to the news and I just said go ahead.\n\nI think it was last October when he had that huge party. I can see his house from mine. I and everyone else around me could hear that shit from 3 miles away. Now I'm waking up to the sound of helicopters around my house while they report this and news vans outside his neighborhood. I'm tired of his shit.

As far as I know there are no publicly available records that show the number of dogs that owners put down - instead of holding on to them and making arrangements with greyhound rescues. I suspect it's a lot.\n\nFormer racing greyhounds make great pets. I have fostered a bunch of them. They are pretty unique. Their bodies have been bred for one purpose (racing) so they have very light bones. deep chests and long tails, which can act as a kind of rudder at high speeds. Behaviorally, these are adult dogs, who - save for exercise a couple of times per day, and occasional races  - have always lived in crates. So it takes time for them to adjust to 'normal' home life'.\n\nTypical challenges for them when they are re-homed include stairs (most have never seen them), smooth floors, etc. Also, having probably only ever seen other greyhounds, they often do not seem to recognize other breeds as dogs. Unsurprisingly, they tend to have off the chart prey drive, which doesn't usually go away. After a month or two, they adjust, and earn their nickname of '40 mile per hour couch potatoes'."

One place avaragely dealt  with 60 people/hour, some places asked the inhabitants to come by the  alphabet or house numbers, however it was just a recomendation and every  person could come to whatever the place they have choosen at any time.\n\nA  lot of responsibility was delegated to the cities and villages, the  mayors had to organise the places where the testing would take place,  administrative workforce, food and PPE for them. A lot of them were  creative. The testing took place in buses, one person entered the bus,  filled the form, continued to the medic who took the swab and got out of  the bus by the other door to wat for results, other places were  military tents on the outside, or some were inside in the schools,  theatres, some were drive ins, but they did not work as well as planed.  Drive in with big capacity at airport was good, however some mayors had  them close to city centers and there were big rows of cars, the waiting  time was long and people were causing congested streets, even some army  vehicles delivering tests and certificates got stuck in them. Some of  the cities and village even contacted the medical staff because army did  not provide enough. They did not recieved the money they invested so  far but the gouverment promises to send them.\n\nThe  government bought the tests (antigen tests from nasal swabs detecting virus protein, that can be evalueted after 20 min, less accurate than pcr, however though to detect a lot of infectious people with high viral load) and printed the certificates of  positivity/negativity that were filled in by hand after the test to  avoid technical problems. The army distributed the test, certificates,  water, and medical stuff (military doctors, 33 austrian army doctors,  200 hungarian medics, and a huge amount of medical stuff who  voulentarlly called the army informing them they want to help, they were  promised 7e/ hour plus 500e if they took the whole weekend shift) and  operatively dealt with the problems occured. The biggest problem was to  find medical stuff, but in the end people wanted to help, all respect to  them, being from 7 to 22 in PPE, whole weekend when in the week they  have a hard work in hospitals, clinics, ... There was also a posibility  for companies with more than 4000 people and hospitals and other medical  facilities to test their employes, their families and patients on their  own, providing only one soldier and tests and certificates, companies  had to organise places and find medical stuff.\n\nAlso  PCR tests from Thursday-Sunday are accepted. It is interesting how it  affected the numbers. People who wanted to have more accurate tests or  did not want to get tested by state paid for the pcr test and the  percentage of positivity declined from 20% to 10% on these days. Last  week there was a lock down (you could work, shop in groceries and  pharmacy and do a sport outside in your region) to stop the spread and  to minimalise the contact between people so there wont be many new  infections the test will not capture.\n\nWithout  the negative test you have to quarantee yourself for 10 days (you can  go out to the nearest pharmacy, groceries, doctor and that is it, you  can not go to the work and wont recieve money for 10 days if your  presence there is required, you can stay on home office if your boss  allows it). With negative test next week you can go to work, all  different types of shops and dine outside. Last week there was a pilot  testing in the most infected regions, so they were tested twice already,  the resulst are interesting. Last week Bardejov positivity rate was  3,52%, this week so far it is 1,29 %. It is still not decided if the  whole country will be tested again next weekend, the plan is to catch  the people who did not have the infection fully developed last week so  the test did not recognise them. They want to test at least the regions  with higher percentage of infected.\n\nI  felt safe during the testing, the people kept the distance, people were  mostly waiting patiently and the stuff was friendly, policemen were  walking past the quees and taking older people and parents with small  children to the front of the que.\n\nThe  biggest problems were the uncertainity before the testing about enough  stuff, big quees on Saturday morning, it got a lot better on Sunday and  the fact, that the government have not done some validation with pcr  tests and even though they are giving an emphasis on the fact, that even  though you are negative on the certificate you can still be infectious  and should not start partying, many people may change their mind set and  the borders are mostly open."

They legally are not allowed to fob you off to someone else.\n\nEdit: The [Australian Competition and Consumer Comission](https://www.accc.gov.au/) also enforces that guarantees apply regardless of any warranties suppliers sell or give to you, and apply for a reasonable time depending on the nature of the goods or services. This means consumer guarantees may continue to apply after the time period for the warranty has expired.\n\nFor example, a cheapie TV is sold with a 3 month warranty and dies after a year? Doesn't matter, must be repaired or replaced as the expected lifetime of a TV is much longer than a year.\n\nSimilarly, Mercedes-Benz Australia was forced to repair a super expensive saloon car because they sold it as \"the ultimate in quality\" --- and that engine mounts failing at only at 60k kms does not constitute \"the ultimate in quality\"."

Should the driver be wounded or killed by shots fired, the vehicle will almost certainly proceed out of control and could become a serious threat to officers and others in the area.\n\n>Officers should consider this use of deadly force only when “a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle,” or when the vehicle is intentionally being used as a deadly weapon and “all other reasonable means of defense have been exhausted (or are not present or practical).” Examples of circumstances in which officers are justified in shooting at a moving vehicle include when an occupant of the vehicle is shooting at the officer or others in the vicinity or, as in what has become an increasingly frequent event, the vehicle itself is being used as a deliberate means to kill others, such as a truck being driven through a crowd of innocent bystanders.\n\n>Even under these circumstances, officers should discharge their firearms at moving vehicles only when doing so will not create unreasonable risk to the safety of officers or others in the vicinity, when reasonable alternatives have been exhausted, and when failure to take such action would likely result in death or serious bodily injury. However, in cases where officers believe that the driver is intentionally attempting to run him or her down, consideration should be given to moving out of the path of the vehicle, if practical, as a possible alternative to using deadly force. The Consensus Policy recognizes that there are times when getting out of the way of the vehicle is not possible and the use of a firearm by the officer is warranted."

                    "text": "Prosecutors quoted from interviews he and his mother made to \"The Times of London\" (or 'The Times' as we call it this side of the pond!) \n\nFor those who can't access beyond the paywall:\n\n“We wanted to show that we’re willing to rise up, band together and fight if necessary. Same as our forefathers, who established this country in 1776,” said Eric Munchel, who had driven from Nashville, Tennessee, with his mother, Lisa Eisenhart.\n\nThe pair were among the crowd who flooded the Capitol the previous afternoon but claimed that they left as soon as demonstrators talked about stealing laptops and government papers. Eisenhart stressed to me that they had gone into the building as “observers” – both wore bulletproof vests — and that her son had told her not to touch anything.\n\nHowever, Twitter sleuths quickly worked to determine that it was Munchel who was caught on camera leaping over railings in the senate chamber in full paramilitary gear – in a photograph that quickly went viral.\n\nDuring our conversation, as they packed their car the following day to go home, Munchel claimed that he had left his guns behind in Tennessee due to strict gun laws in Washington but, unsurprisingly, didn’t mention that he had been clutching a handful of plastic zip ties while storming the Capitol. These are the restraints typically used by police to detain individuals, and it’s unclear what Munchel’s intention was with them. The photograph led to speculation that the rioters were potentially planning to take hostages. The riot left five people, including a police officer, dead.\n\n“It was a kind of flexing of muscles,” said Munchel, who wore a bulletproof vest and complained that police confiscated his Taser during the riot. “The intentions of going in were not to fight the police. The point of getting inside the building is to show them that we can, and we will.”\n\nPreparing for their 10-hour drive home, the 30-year-old clamoured for greater organisation in the next steps to fight against Biden’s America. He worried that many pro-Trump warriors were individualists and lamented that potential leaders in the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement faced difficulty in rallying troops due to banishment from mainstream social media sites. “Our biggest struggle is getting together, knowing where to go, what to do and who to go to,” said Munchel despondently.\n\nHis mother agreed: “The left has everything: the media, organisations, the government. We have to organise if we’re going to fight back and be heard.” Eisenhart, a nurse, added that a violent revolution has long been on the cards thanks to last year’s racial justice protests, anti-police riots and “unnecessary” coronavirus lockdowns.\n\n“This country was founded on revolution. If they’re going to take every legitimate means from us, and we can’t even express ourselves on the internet, we won’t even be able to speak freely, what is America for?” said a teary-eyed Eisenhart, biting into a hotdog. “I’d rather die as a 57-year-old woman than live under oppression. I’d rather die and would rather fight.”"

But Trump’s delusions about the results combined with the fact that he’s *supposed to be the fucking President*, or at least act like it, is a whole other ballgame and, honestly, it’s disgraceful to all of us living in this country. What’s disheartening is that this has been telegraphed as his playcall since August and people are really still eating it up."

The second prosecutor went after Olivia Pearson for helping someone vote. She is lucky to be free as one juror would not convict her to a 15 year sentence.

Want to know my position on this? The guys are clearly guilty of premeditated murder, the DA who let them go deserves to be fired and given *at least* a trial to determine if they deserve a prison sentence of their own and the man who was murdered was doing things any *normal* human being would do when jogging down the street and when confronted with armed assailants he attempted to defend himself while unarmed and thus these two men can *in no way* claim it was self-defense when they shot him multiple times. My point with the last paragraph was that the ***new investigation*** was quoted on their ***second day*** after ***arresting the shooters*** and ***name dropped*** the person who probably let them go. That's ***miles ahead*** of what it was like in the friggin 1960s and 70s."

Then the story died down and I figured eventually the info got released.

Why the hell is this administration fighting so hard to prevent that?  \n\n....

I have my opinions, which I haven't shared. If anybody says anything at this point, it's speculation. I can't remember if the user I'm talking about specified where he *thought* it was coming from either. All I was pointing out is that he said there was an announcement of some sort being made, he heard it, rightfully got nervous, and left. Maybe he was making it up. Maybe he got details wrong. The point is that when I saw his comment, nobody else said \"*I was there* and that didn't happen.\" Instead, most replies said something like \"I didn't see that reported. You're a troll.

The magazine’s best standing feature, the Playboy Interview, remains pretty good, even in its seventh decade. (I recommend that you start with the one from February 1975, with Mel Brooks. According to the announcement, the Interview will continue to be published online.) And it remains a name and label that means something to a great many people, and that itself is worth money, because Playboy remains a huge licensing operation. Those spangled bunny baby tees, ubiquitous in Los Angeles boutiques, pay pretty well.\n\nThe magazine dies but the brand will survive."

Our ICU was at capacity over the weekend, so I was holding (taking care of) two patients waiting for ICU beds in the Emergency Department. They both waited over 24 hours. They have shut down PACU and any non-emergent surgery to turn that unit into an overflow ICU. \n\nMy current schedule is working 5 shifts/week instead of 3, because there isn’t enough nurses to man the ICI overflow. \n\nYet my concern is for those non-covid related admissions who have a delay of care because we are over-saturated with COVID-19 patients. For example, we are not a Comprehensive Stroke Center, and do not have a neurosurgeon at our hospital. On Saturday night I received a woman who had stroke symptoms, imaging of the head showed she was having a hemorrhagic stroke (brain bleed). Our hospital would typically immediately transfer this woman to a comprehensive center that had a neurosurgeon, but all the hospitals from LA to Las Vegas who could take her are full. Took until Monday evening to get her to a hospital that could actually help her. But that time her neurological exam had worsened and she had a midline shift of 6mm (her brain was being compressed and damaged by the pocket of blood stuck in her skull). Her care was delayed because of COVID...smh\n\nEdit: imaging\n\nEdit 2: mm"

The only way to beat him is to turn the people against him en masse. That's why everything he's been doing is made super public. Becuase the more Russian people that are watching intently, the harder it becomes for Putin to feed them lies and the harder it becomes to to silence critics.\n\nIf Navalny dies, he is a martyr, a rallying cry, and the perfect emblem of Putin's violent corruption. If Navalny dies, then Putin is a murderer. A fact which is obvious, yet Putin goes to great lengths to deny.

The study’s authors concluded that the chance of this occurring in a race-neutral process was less than 1 in 10 trillion\n\n* Even after adjusting for excuses given by prosecutors that tend to correlate with race, the 2-to-1 discrepancy remained\n\n* The state legislature had previously passed a law stating that death penalty defendants who could demonstrate racial bias in jury selection could have their sentences changed to life without parole. The legislature later repealed that law\n\n**Levinson et al. 10**\n\n* “Mock jurors” were given the same evidence from a fictional robbery case but then shown alternate security camera footage depicting either a light-skinned or dark-skinned suspect\n\n* Jurors were more likely to evaluate ambiguous, race-neutral evidence against the dark-skinned suspect as incriminating and more likely to find the dark-skinned suspect guilty\n\n**Johnson et al. 12**\n\n* “Black defendants who kill white victims are seven times as likely to receive the death penalty as are black defendants who kill black victims. … Moreover, black defendants who kill white victims are more than three times as likely to be sentenced to death as are white defendants who kill white victims.”\n\n**UNC 11**\n\n* Murderers who kill white people are three times more likely to get the death penalty than murderers who kill black people\n\n**Baldus et al. 04**\n\n* “One quarter to one third of death sentenced defendants with white victims would have avoided the death penalty if their victims had been black.”\n\n**Beckett et al. 14**\n\n* Looking at 33 years of data found that after adjusting for variables such as the number of victims and brutality of the crimes, jurors in Washington state were 4.5 times more likely to impose the death penalty on black defendants accused of aggravated murder than on white ones\n\n**Gross et al. 17**\n\n* Black people are more likely to be wrongly convicted of murder when the victim was white. Only about 15 percent of people killed by black people were white, but 31 percent of black exonerees were wrongly convicted of killing white people. More generally, black people convicted of murder are 50 percent more likely to be innocent than white people convicted of murder\n\n* Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be wrongly convicted of sexual assault and 12 times more likely to be wrongly convicted of drug crimes. (And remember, data on wrongful convictions is limited in that it can only consider the wrongful convictions we know about.)\n\n**Eberhardt et al. 06**\n\n* This study found that when a black person was accused of killing a white person, defendants with darker skin and more “stereotypically black” features were twice as likely to receive a death sentence. When the victim was black, there was almost no difference\n\nSource: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OIVHtml45EcMSi3suI5Zn1ymef5Y-8hnHbeY6kxp-ec/"

For anyone curious:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker\\_v.\\_Texas\\_Division,\\_Sons\\_of\\_Confederate\\_Veterans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_v._Texas_Division,_Sons_of_Confederate_Veterans)\n\nSo it seems this law is mostly legal, with the exception being the provision that the state is also outlawing not just itself from displaying hate symbols, but anyone at state-owned fairgrounds. I expect that portion of the law to be struck down by the courts."

                    "text": "[Fixed link](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/dr-anthony-fauci-pleads-with-young-people-youre-propagating-the-pandemic.html):\n\nWhite House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci urged young Americans to not take the coronavirus lightly, saying doing so could propagate the pandemic. \n\n“You have to have responsibility for yourself but also a societal responsibility that you’re getting infected is not just you in a vacuum. You’re propagating the pandemic,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  in an interview Thursday evening.\n\nThe comment by Fauci came as state health officials say more young people are ignoring social distancing measures and contracting the virus at a higher rate. Fauci said the average age of a new Covid-19 patient has dropped by 15 years since the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S.\n\nVice President Mike Pence warned last month that roughly half of the new cases in the U.S. were people under the age of 35, particularly in Florida and Texas.\nwatch now\nVIDEO02:00\nDr. Anthony Fauci: Average age of U.S. coronavirus patients has dropped by 15 years\n\nFauci said young people at bars enjoying themselves is “totally understandable.” But he warned that young people who are asymptomatic, who never develop symptoms, can also pass the virus on to others.\n\n“I get that,” he said Thursday. “I was there at one point in my life. Or see people in crowds and you say well, they think they’re not doing anything that’s particularly harmful, but they might be.”\n\nFauci had warned last month that doctors and infectious disease specialists were seeing “more and more” complications with Covid-19 in young people.\n\nEarly in the outbreak in the U.S., researchers said the virus appeared to be sparing young people while being particularly severe for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThat’s not the case, Fauci said during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on June 23. “To think young people have no deleterious consequences is not true. We’re seeing more and more complications in young people.”\n\nFauci said he’s never seen a single virus have such a wide range of symptoms.\n\nSome people have no symptoms while “some get mild symptoms and some get symptoms enough to put them at home for a few days. Some are in bed for weeks and have symptoms even after they recover, others go to the hospital, some require oxygen, some require intensive care, some get intubated and some die,” he said.\n\nFauci was appointed director of NIAID in 1984 and has worked under six U.S. presidents. \n\nIn recent days, President Donald Trump and other administration officials have been critical about Fauci’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDespite the criticism, Fauci told “The Atlantic” magazine that he hasn’t thought about resigning. “I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions,” he said, according to an edited transcript of the interview. “I just want to do my job. I’m really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I’m going to keep doing it.”"

He resigned but was sworn in on Monday as a deputy in a nearby county.\n\n>Joseph Mensah, in an undated photo while he was a Wauwatosa, Wis., police officer. Joseph Mensah, in an undated photo while he was a Wauwatosa, Wis., police officer. Credit... Gary Monreal/Monreal Photography Llc/Wauwatosa Police Department, via AP Jan. 27, 2021 A former police officer in Wauwatosa, Wis., who shot and killed three people during his tenure and resigned following protests last year, became a law enforcement officer again on Monday when he was sworn in as a deputy sheriff just across the county line.\n\n>The deputy, Joseph Mensah, resigned from the Wauwatosa Police Department in November. He now works for the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Office, which announced the hiring in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n>“While some have expressed concerns about Mr. Mensah’s past uses of force, I assembled a team who exhaustively reviewed Mr. Mensah’s previous work history,” the Waukesha County sheriff, Eric Severson, said in the statement.\n\n>That team, he said, concluded that Mr. Mensah’s uses of force had been consistent with the law, as did a handful of internal and independent investigations last year.\n\n>When Tracy Cole of Milwaukee heard the news, her heart sank. Last year, Mr. Mensah shot and killed her son, Alvin Cole, who would have turned 18 last week. “It’s just a slap in my face, and my family’s face,” said Ms. Cole, 49. “I just want to see justice, for once.”\n\n>Mr. Mensah, a Black officer who joined the Wauwatosa department in 2015, shot Mr. Cole, an armed Black teenager, in a mall parking lot on Feb. 2. In October, John Chisholm, the Milwaukee district attorney, said he would not prosecute Mr. Mensah for the shooting. He said officers had reported that Mr. Cole pointed a gun at them at one point and that he had fired the gun while running away.\n\n>The episode brought additional scrutiny into Mr. Mensah’s two previous fatal shootings. In 2016, he shot a man named Jay Anderson Jr. in his car after he said Mr. Anderson reached for a gun. In 2015, Mr. Mensah and another officer fatally shot Antonio Gonzalez, who was wielding a sword when he was confronted by the police.\n\n>Mr. Chisholm’s decision came on the same day that an independent investigator issued a report recommending that Mr. Mensah be fired. The investigator, Steven M. Biskupic, said in his report that Mr. Mensah had made “inconsistent and misleading” statements about fatal shootings.\n\n>In the case of Mr. Cole’s shooting, Mr. Biskupic said that Mr. Cole had not fired at police officers during the pursuit and had accidentally shot himself in the arm.\n\n>Mr. Mensah was suspended with pay in July. He agreed to resign on Nov. 30 as part of a “separation agreement” with the Wauwatosa Peace Officers Association, the police union, and the Common Council, the governing body of Wauwatosa, which is a suburb of Milwaukee.\n\n>According to a copy of that agreement, the city agreed to give Mr. Mensah 13 months’ pay in severance and an additional $15,000 and part of his health insurance costs.\n\n>On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview with WISN 12, the local ABC News affiliate, Sheriff Severson said that he had not solicited an application from Mr. Mensah and that he had reviewed Mr. Mensah’s record carefully.\n\n>“If my family needs a police officer, I hope Joseph Mensah is the first one at my door,” he added. “That’s how confident I am in his ability.”\n\n>Kimberley Motley, a lawyer for the Cole family, said the hire was “disrespectful to the mourning families.”\n\n>“I think this was clearly an emotionally charged decision, as opposed to an intelligent decision,” she added. “The amount of legal liability has widened in Waukesha County.”\n\n>Barry M. Weber, the chief of the Wauwatosa Police Department, signed a letter of recommendation for Mr. Mensah. On Wednesday, the department shared that letter on Twitter.\n\n>“He proved himself to be an excellent police officer,” said the letter, which was dated Dec. 23. It added that Mr. Mensah was “an articulate, thoughtful and intelligent man” who had been “placed in some difficult situations and responded in a thoughtful and professional manner.”\n\n>Phone and email contacts for Mr. Mensah could not be found, and a lawyer who has represented him did not respond to inquiries by phone and email on Wednesday.\n\n>In a radio interview with Dan O’Donnell of WISN in Milwaukee in July, two months after George Floyd had died at the hands of the Minneapolis police, Mr. Mensah said protesters had approached his property and confronted his family members. And he questioned why protests had erupted in 2020 even though two of his fatal shootings took place years earlier.\n\n>“I feel for those families,” he added. “It was not my intention to go out there and kill their loved ones.”\n\n>Ms. Cole said that she had feared for her family since her son died. She and her daughters have participated in demonstrations calling for Mr. Mensah to be prosecuted, and two of her daughters have been arrested. She said that on Oct. 8, she was stopped in her car by police officers who were enforcing a curfew intended to quash protests.\n\n>In video of the stop that was posted on Facebook, she can be heard saying, “Don’t touch me,” and identifying herself as Alvin Cole’s mother as officers threaten to arrest her and use a Taser on her. “I can’t breathe,” she can be heard saying. “I can’t believe you all did this to me.”\n\n>On Wednesday, Ms. Cole said that the injuries she sustained on that day had not healed and that learning about Mr. Mensah’s position with the sheriff’s department added insult to those injuries.\n\n>“We cry every night,” Ms. Cole said. “When is it going to stop? We need change. We need police to be accountable for what they do.”\n\n>Maria Cramer contributed reporting."

I tried to get someone to talk to me about it. A lot of people I respected, and were close with, knew he needed help. They also knew we were friends. My last two months were really strange, and distant, because everyone avoided me, then I EASed. \n\nI never found a way to reach his mom. I still try a few times a year.\n\nEDIT: 1/06/21 I reached her tonight at 8:42pm, and we talked a long time. I also linked this to her. She gets too see that all of you cared about her son enough on here to achieve this.\n\nKyle's death was not ruled as a suicide, and some portions of what happened, were what led to us deciding to advocate for a change to his discharge.

I know he was gay and a crossdresser, and that seemed to make a lot of people uncomfortable and he received a lot of harassment due to it, I'd hear my superiors talk about how they weren't fond of him.\n\nA few months into deployment, he told a friend that he was suicidal and they put him on suicide watch. Suicide watch means that your department has to provide sailors on 2 hour rotations, 24 hours a day, every day to watch this guy and make sure he doesn't do anything. They put you in a small empty room with two chairs and you're not permitted to take anything in there with you, nothing that someone could use to harm themselves. \n\nSo now imagine the people that bullied you, harassed you, hated you, and made you feel like an outsider, now you have them on 2 hour rotations watching over you - while you eat, sleep, and do nothing in a tiny cramped room with them. I heard several of the upper ranks complaining about having to be on these rotations, because sometimes their rotation interfered with their sleep schedule (a common occurrence in the Navy). \n\nThe worst part, and the reason why I didn't use my chain of command when I sought help, was the number of superiors within my division that managed to get off the rotations list because they told medical they wouldn't be a good fit.\n\nBecause they said if they were in a room with him, they'd tell him to finish it.\n\nThere's been a lot of culture shock in my time in the Navy. When talking to people and they say something overtly racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, anything of the sorts - and realizing there's a lot of people that you can't talk to.\n\nTwo months ago I had a suicide attempt. Nothing happened, and nobody found out, but I talked to the psych a week later and they scheduled me for a consult the following week, but due to the crazy situation with the boat and covid, I talked to the wrong psychiatrist (our medical facility was moved to somewhere else), and they rescheduled me for the right psych a week later. I told them about the suicide attempt, and they've been helpful so far in removing me from the environment, but this is while we're in-port, not on deployment.\n\nThe worst part was when the chain of command was notified. I talked to the psych on a Friday, and the following Monday my entire chain of command had been notified. My supervisor, who was a direct contributor to my mental health state, my chief, my senior chief, my division officer, both Master Chiefs, and both of the head departmental officers.\n\nBy this point, it's now been a month after the attempt, and I've been in touch with the psychiatrist for almost 3 weeks. Now having 8 people pull me aside privately to ask me if I'm okay, and why I didn't say anything about it before, why I didn't use my chain of command.\n\nBecause your sailors are listening to everything you say. When you tell them \"I'd tell a suicidal sailor to off themselves so we don't have dead weight\", they're listening. When the sailors get punished for seeking help, they're observing. This is why they don't get help."

I did not do well for the first 3 weeks and finally reported to my TI to see a chaplain and start the process of washing out.  \n\nShe yelled at me to close the fucking door and sit my candy ass down.  As soon as the door was shut she became an actual person, used my first name instead of my nickname and told me to relax.  She asked me what exactly was keeping me from becoming an Airman and generally just talked to me for a good 15 minutes.  She just told me to keep my head down and see it all for what it is: a show.  She'd been keeping an eye on me for a few days and knew I was near a breaking point.\n\nAs I opened the door she put her campaign hat back on and became a TI again.  I did a bunch of pushups for 'bothering' her and was told I'd be shining a half dozen pair of boots during rest.  That became my job for the rest of Basic, and I was good at it.  Helped me gel with my flight and I had a really successful career for the next 8 years.\n\nI really wish this guy had a Sgt Whitlock to talk to."

Accessible (read: affordable), reliable, federal mail is a constitutionally protected right.\n\nEdit about “rights:”\n\nI’ll grant you the postal clause is not phrased like the fourth amendment, which starts “the right of the people...” instead the postal code is an “enumerated power,” meaning that the congress is expressly permitted to do it, and no one else is. It is a mandate “To establish Post Offices and Post Roads.\" That mandate is to your benefit—it’s your right. \n\nThere isn’t a long list of job descriptions for congress, but the job includes our permission to do 18 centralized things on our behalf.  These are the enumerated powers, delegated to the federal government—impliedly not reserved for the states.  **It’s their job. And it’s our right to have them do a good job.**\n\nThe congress has other core, enumerated powers like making appropriations for an army, levying taxes, coining money, and defending copyrights.  Congress is  charged to do these, and we as Americans should demand they do these jobs well and fairly. Anyone flagging this isn’t a right is technically correct, but in your thirst for accuracy you’ve abandoned the spirit of the constitution."

I greatly appreciate your engagement and input on the issues facing our nation today.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed H.R 748, the CARES Act, into law. Recognizing the budget challenges that COVID-19 has placed on USPS, the CARES Act gives USPS the authority to borrow up to $10 billion to meet their operating expenses.\n\nArticle I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads. The United States postal Service is a core function of the federal government, however I am concerned with the fiscal stability of the organization. Recent headlines have focused on cost cutting measures taken by the Trump administration to reform the Postal Service. In order to fulfill our Constitutional mandate, Congress must also work to address the long-term fiscal sustainability of the U.S. Postal Service and its operations. Any moving of sorting machines or mailboxes under the current administration is a completely normal function of resource allocation meant to meet changing postal flows.\n\nThe postal service was in need of reform years before COVID-19 or President Trump. Those reforms should be addressed separately by Congress. As Congress continues to debate further COVID-19 related legislation, I will continue to monitor USPS's needs and carefully consider any further requests that they make to Congress. \n\n\nThank you again for reaching out to my office, and please do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can assist you with.\n\nBest regards,\n \nMichael S. Lee\nUnited States Senator"

On July 11, at the exercise, CROFT and a member of the militia group attempted to construct an improvised explosive device (“IED”), using black powder, balloons, a fuse, and BBs for shrapnel. CROFT, GARBIN and the militia group member attempted to make a second IED using similar components. The construction of the devices was faulty, and they did not detonate as planned. CHS-2 provided FBI with video of the event.  FRANKS also brought and fired a rifle with a silencer at the exercise. Attendees shared photos and video recordings of the exercise in Facebook discussions that included CHS-2. \n\n--\n\n>17.On July 27, 2020, CHS-2 met FOX at his business in Grand Rapids. CHS-2 provided the FBI with an audio recording of the meeting.  FOX said their best opportunity to abduct Governor Whitmer would be when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Governor’s official summer residence. Both residences are located in the Western District of Michigan. FOX described it as a “Snatch and grab, man.  Grab the fuckin’ Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it’s over.” FOX said that after kidnapping the Governor, the group would remove her to a secure location in Wisconsin for “trial.” FOX suggested they get a realtor to help them find the exact location of the vacation home and collect information on the surrounding homes and structures. FOX discussed the importance of knowing the layout of the yard, homes, and security.  FOX stated they needed to map out the surrounding property and gates, and they needed plumbers and electricians to help them read blueprints to refine their strategy. FOX also suggested recruiting an engineer or “IT [Information Technology] guy,” a “demo guy,” and other “operators.”\n\n----\n\nFriendly reminder that \"trial\" means summary execution.\n\nAlso they planned to blow up a bridge.\n\n>FOX, CROFT, CHS-2, a UCE, and an individual from Wisconsin traveled in the first vehicle. While in the vehicle, CROFT and FOX discussed detonating explosive devices to divert police from the area of the vacation home. They stopped at the M-31 highway bridge on the way, where FOX and the UCE inspected the underside of the bridge for places to seat an explosive charge. FOX took a picture of the bridge’s support structure, which he later shared with CHS-2 in their encrypted chat. From there, they drove to a public boat launch across the lake from the vacation home to watch for the other cars in their group."

But the coroner said he was 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighed 140 pounds.\n\nAccording to documents shared by Aurora Fire Rescue, the standard dose of ketamine is 5 milligrams per each kilogram of a person's weight. That would mean that instead of 500 milligrams of ketamine, McClain should have received about 320 milligrams.\n\nand from the Nursing Drug handbook - IM:\n-Induction: 6.5 to 13 mg/kg IM; (9 to 13 mg/kg IM provides 12 to 25 minutes of surgical anesthesia)\n-Maintenance: The maintenance dose should be adjusted according to the patient's anesthetic needs and whether an additional anesthetic is employed. Increments of one-half to the full induction dose may be repeated as needed for maintenance of anesthesia.\n\nComments:\n-This drug should be administered slowly over a period of 60 seconds (more rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced pressor response).\n-The larger the total dose, the longer will be complete recovery.\n-Because of rapid induction following the initial IV injection, the patient should be in a supported position during administration."

Lowe's store managers (and I'm assuming corporate bigwigs) have systematically been hiding who tests positive in the store. The positive associates are told NOT to post on social media about it and to not discuss it with employees. I understand the whole medical privacy thing, but they're not quarantining ANY other employees that have had extensive contact with other positive employees. We only find out who exactly was sick AFTER their quarantine ends and they come back.\n\nOther stores have mentioned the same thing, I don't know if every single store is doing this, but every single one that I've spoken with is following this same guideline.\n\nI really hope I can get this information out. I know it may sound stupid but this company doesn't give two shits about the associates and it really shows."

                    "text": "Article since it’s getting hugged:\n\n\nAtlanta, GA —  The head of Atlanta’s police union confirmed Wednesday that officers from the Atlanta Police Department in Zones 3 and 6 walked off the job Wednesday afternoon.\n\nVince Champion, southeast regional director of the International Brotherhood of Police officers, said that police officers had stopped answering calls midshift, in response to charges against Officer Garrett Rolfe who is accused of murdering Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.\n\n“The union, we would never advocate this. We wouldn’t advocate a blue flu,” Champion said. “We don’t know the numbers. Apparently we’re learning that command staff are asking outlying counties for support and aren’t getting it.”\n\nDecaturish has calls out to public affairs officers in Gwinnett, DeKalb and Cobb counties for confirmation. A message to the spokesperson for Atlanta Police was not immediately returned.\n\nA spokesperson for APD called reports of a walkout “inaccurate.”\n\n“Earlier suggestions that multiple officers from each zone had walked off the job were inaccurate,” the spokesperson said. “However, the department is experiencing a higher than usual number of call-outs with the incoming shift. We have enough resources to maintain operations and remain able to respond to incidents throughout the city.”\n\nZones 3 and 6 cover south Atlanta, where Rolfe killed Rayshard Brooks after a June 12 DUI arrest turned into an altercation. Rolfe fired three bullets at Brooks as he fled with a taser in hand. Video of the shooting suggests Brooks pointed the taser at officers as he fled.\n\nA protest the next day descended into vandalism and the arson of the Wendy’s restaurant where the shooting occurred. Police and state fire officials have offered a reward for tips leading to the arrest and prosecution of the arsonists.\n\nChampion accused Paul Howard, Fulton county’s district attorney, of lying about what is happening in a press conference earlier today when Howard suggested that officer Devin Brosnan had turned state’s evidence and is testifying.\n\n“The attorney for the officer said that’s not true two minutes later, and said he’s not pleading guilty and not offering state’s evidence,” Champion said.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated when more information is received."

I work in Healthcare. \n\nIn Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the local, state, and federal government failed to evacuate the local hospitals and many of the senior/nursing homes before the storm. They also failed to evacuate them after, leaving staff to suffer as they tried to keep acutely ill people alive for days in horrendous conditions with no power, no running water, no oxygen, city-wide floods, and sewage backups. The death tolls in hospitals were horrendous. The PTSD of staff off the charts. Many felt abandoned by their hospital admin and governments as they begged for helicopters to evacuate their dying patients. As many people in this thread point out, there are books, journal articles, etc about this nightmare of events and how it unfolded in the worst ways at Memorial Baptist and Charity Hospitals. \n\nSo when I see, 15 years almost to the day, that hospitals in the path of a category 4 hurricane chose to leave their patients and staff as the roof of the hospital ripped off, as windows from many buildings blew out from the pressure, as unsurprisingly there will be NO power or water for weeks... what I wonder is WHY do we sacrifice this staff to hand bag (literally to pump oxygen into the premature lungs of NICU patients) babies as the power went out for days, to hope they could keep them alive without any of the electrical-dependent equipment and pyxis machines full of meds, when they had DAYS to know this storm was coming and to evacuate these patients and staff. \n\nI 100% have no doubt these nurses did everything in their power to take care of these babies but it is a mass failure od our government and social system to abandon them to conditions we KNEW were highly likely to deteriorate in deadly weather and hope they would sacrifice their lives to care for their patients. It took the hospital a mere 2 hours to evac; we knew about this storm's path days before Thursday. \n\nThey are heroes. But they deserve so much better than a little hazard pay and the PTSD from holding a premature infant and hand pumping oxygen in a Cat 4 storm praying they don't all die."

This post is meant to inform readers of why it is allowed. It is not intended to be a debate over the merits of gun ownership.\n\nYou can't carry it in your carry on luggage or on your person.  It must be stored unloaded, in a hard sided case, using a lock that only the owner can unlock.  You complete and sign a card stating that your luggage contains a firearm stowed in accordance with federal law.  That card is then placed inside your luggage.  The ink used to print that card is a special ink that will appear on an Xray image.\n\nIf the TSA needs to open your luggage, you must be present while it is examined.\n\nNone of this is new.  It's been the law for many many years.  If you think about it, it's only reasonable that people who have legitimate reasons to travel with a firearm, such as hunting trips, shooting competitions, police officers, etc. Must have some means to travel with their firearms.  \n\nI'm a concealed carry permit holder, and I regularly travel to other states where my permit is recognized.  While I stay in my hotel, I have the right to protect my space as if it were my home.  When I leave the hotel for some function where I must leave myfirearm behind, i store it in the hotel safe, not my room safe.  Most reputable hotel chains have safe deposit boxes that require the guests key and the desk agents key to open."

The latest, found yesterday, has not had his identity released. \n\nI wonder if the realization that a string of hangings has occurred is what made the coroner to recount their ruling?\n\nEdit: I’m adding this because too many of you are assuming that I’m implying that these were murders. I never said that nor have I insinuated I believed that. My concerns on the trends are more about whether or not they were ruled on so quickly and carelessly without full autopsies because these men are black. I feel a full autopsy should’ve been done since day one for all these men. I also feel a ruling shouldn’t have been given until AFTER a FULL autopsy, toxicology and investigative report was performed by both the police and coroner. These rulings were given a few hours after the bodies were found and reported to news outlets.\n\nEdit 2: a lot of you are focused on the fact that I noted their race. With everything that is happening globally, yes, I’d say their race is important when determining if a ruling should be given so soon(literally a few hours) after finding their bodies. It’s careless on the part of police and coroners to give a public ruling so soon without performing a full autopsy on the BLACK men who were PUBLICLY HANGED during the BLACK LIVES MATTER movement. This should be delved into and carried out with more diligence and care. I hope that they weren’t overlooked for a FULL investigation because of their race."

                    "text": "I actually remember seeing some of these documents in /r/Coronavirus back in February. If you look at China’s case count in the Spring, you’ll notice a dramatic spike during February and then a sharp decrease in the number of new cases in March.\n\nThe February spike happened because China was previously only reporting cases based on positive test results. However, there were severe testing shortages during this time, and the tests themselves were not very accurate (cotton swabs had to be probed deep inside your nose to pick up any active virus or fragments). This presented a problem to health officials because you can’t admit a patient for treatment without a positive diagnosis, and without enough testing supplies, you can’t catch all the cases.\n\nSo the solution was to start allowing doctors to diagnose patients using X-ray and ~~MRI~~ CT instead of the test kit. By this time, they learned that Covid patients often had distinct scarring in their lower lungs that resembled ~~shattered~~ ground glass. These patients were now included in the statistics under a new category called “diagnosed cases.”\n\nHowever, the inclusion of this new category led to a sudden spike in the case count, and China received a ton of international criticism that pointed to this increase as evidence of a cover up. You can make your own judgment as to which side to believe, but I’ll just point out that when NY began revising their statistics upward by counting probable cases, it was considered as a sign of transparency, but when China did the same thing in February, it was seen as evidence of deception.\n\nThe CNN article also points out another date in March that they found suspicious, which was basically the time when China decided to stop reporting the x-ray diagnosed cases. This occurred because of increased testing capabilities and also in part because their attempt to report more accurate statsitics somehow backfired and resulted in more distrust. So, China basically decided to revert back to the previous way of reporting Covid (i.e., diagnosis through test kits rather than through x-ray).\n\nThis of course led to a sudden drop in average daily cases, which caused another wave of international criticism because the more conservative method of diagnosis was also seen as evidence of cover up. The CNN article suggests that this gave China cover to downplay the spread of Covid, but it’s important to note that the WHO guideline was actually to report test kit results only, which was the reporting standard followed by most countries at this time. Thus, by reverting back to their previous reporting methodology, China was basically complying with international standards.\n\nAgain you can make up your own mind as to what China’s true motives were, but I just want to highlight “a damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation they were in. No matter what China did, any changes was viewed as a cover up even though there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation of making changes in the name of more accuracy or more consistency.\n\nLastly, what feels a little biased with the CNN article is that they actually point out many of the points I’ve brought up above. However, they frame everything in the most cynical way possible even though other countries took similar actions in revising their reporting standards later on, but none of them were the subject of this amount of cynicism.\n\n\\*Note: crossposted my own reply for more visibility"

                    "text": "Full article from The Times:  \n\nThe Japanese government has privately concluded that the Tokyo Olympics will have to be cancelled because of the coronavirus, and the focus is now on securing the Games for the city in the next available year, 2032.\n\nAccording to a senior member of the ruling coalition, there is agreement that the Games, already postponed a year, are doomed. The aim now is to find a face-saving way of announcing the cancellation that leaves open the possibility of Tokyo playing host at a later date. “No one wants to be the first to say so but the consensus is that it’s too difficult,” the source said. “Personally, I don’t think it’s going to happen.”\n\nPublicly, both the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government insist that the Games can go ahead. “We will have full anti-infection measures in place and proceed with preparation and with a determination to achieve the Games that can deliver hope and courage throughout the world,” Yoshihide Suga, the prime minister, told parliament this week.\n\nBut the source said that the global winter wave of coronavirus has tipped the balance, having forced a state of emergency on Japan’s biggest cities, including Tokyo.\n\nFar from being a celebration of athleticism and international harmony, the Olympics have the potential to be a massive super-spreader event. Opinion polls show that 80 per cent of Japanese people are against the Games going ahead in July and August.\n\nThe Australian Open tennis tournament, due to begin on February 8, is beset by problems relating to coronavirus. More than 1,200 people have flown to Melbourne for the event, with several cases detected, and there has been a row with officials after some players were confined to their hotel rooms.\n\nThe cancellation of the Olympics would be a financial disaster for Japan, which has spent at least $25 billion on preparations — three quarters of which was public money. The aim now is to maintain the façade of battling determinedly to go ahead in the hope that when they are inevitably cancelled the 2032 Games will be given to Tokyo out of sympathy.\n\nParis is due to host the Games in 2024 and Los Angeles has been chosen as the venue for 2028. A decision on which city will stage the Olympics in 2032 is expected to be taken by 2025.\n\n“Suga is not emotionally invested in the Games,” the senior source says. “But they want to show that they are ready to go, so that they will get another chance in 11 years. In these circumstances, no one could really object to that.” Sponsored\n\nThe Olympics were called off in 1916, 1940 and 1944 because of world wars; this would be the first cancellation in peacetime. The challenge is to find a way of cancelling while still saving face for the Japanese government and IOC. Last year the decision to postpone the Games for a year was made after Canada and Australia announced that they would not send athletes. “If someone like President Biden was to say that US athletes cannot go, then we could say, ‘Well, now it is impossible’,” the senior source said.\n\nThe latest idea being pushed by the IOC is a televised Olympics with athletes but no spectators. This would suit the committee, which makes most of its income from broadcast rights, but not the Japanese authorities, which would make their money from ticket sales. Such an option has been ruled out by Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister who is head of the Tokyo organising committee. Mr Mori, 83, a power broker in Mr Suga’s Liberal Democratic Party, has lung cancer. To some in the party, cancellation would rob an ailing man of his final dream."

Spinning inertia is one of the biggest reasons why moving to a 100% renewable grid was always going to be impossible, because you need the spinning inertia of your turbines to balance the grid.\n\nI'm far more interested in the results of the [Hornsdale Power Reserve synthetic inertia trial run](https://arena.gov.au/projects/hornsdale-power-reserve-upgrade/) than I am about solar meeting peak demand for 2 hours."

The headline sort of makes it seem as if it provided all the power necessary for the entire day, which it didn't. We're still a long way from that, if ever, using solar alone, due to battery technology.\n\nEdit: That wasn't meant to diminish the accomplishment, just clarify the headline, which I initially thought implied the use of some revolutionary energy storage tech, but really is more a policy/implementation success story.\n\nEdit: Although I was referring to chemical energy batteries, lots of people have brought up that energy storage can also be accomplished through many other means, e.g. hydro and inertial storage systems. Those are probably part of the solution too. Though it seems (from a layman's perspective) that their value is more a function of resources and not technology, whereas as electric batteries seem to get better with more R&D. Either way, storage is still a hurdle for all solar power, and I'm guessing (correct me if I'm wrong) that we'd have to go through many iterations before we were comfortable enough pulling the plug on nuclear.\n\nEdit: Also don't take that to mean I'm anti-nuclear. If we continue to improve our implementation or perhaps make the jump to fusion, then there's no reason nuclear can't continue to be part of our energy sources.\n\nEdit: Damn, I don't deserve a medal, but read the interesting discussions in the thread for far more info than I could possibly provide!"

You are given this experience that most people will never get, and now you're expected to just go back off into society. And that society is not a cohesive group working towards a common goal, but one which seems content to actively sabotage and harm each other in order to get ahead.

And of a sudden it's banned after and he's a criminal,\" Orlando told The Associated Press.\n\nHe didn't become a criminal because the move was later unsanctioned, he was a criminal because he used it illegally to murder someone. At that point it doesn't matter how 'legal' or sanctioned your 'move' is, your intent and misuse of it becomes illegal. Just like if you take a legally registered vehicle and smash it intentionally into a crowd of people. You were driving a legal car, but it's illegal because you drove it in an illegal and dangerous manner you stupid fuck."

With some residents working 18 days in a row.  Many of our “days off” are spent ‘charting’ patients, doing call duty, or research.  Residents have some of the [highest suicide rates](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20180508/doctors-suicide-rate-highest-of-any-profession#1) of any profession, and we regularly face a [hazing culture](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/survey-data-suggests-widespread-bullying-by-superiors-in-medical-residency-training) that abuses us.\n\nWhat many people don’t know is that we are FREE LABOR.  Hospital systems (including non-profit academic centers) don’t pay for our salary, so they treat us like indentured servants.  The US govt (through taxpayers) funds a MINIMUM of [$100k to train](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-pays-for-resident-sal_b_12967008) each physician resident in order to serve medicare needs of the population.  Yet, our average salary is in the 50s, so they largely pocket the remainder!  But that’s not it - they then profit on us by [an average of $165k to $218k](https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/private-equity-selling-medical-residencies-for-profit.html) (some up to $300k) for billable work.  It’s a scam.\n\nMeanwhile, many of us have to opt-in to pay our own health insurance, and of course that of our family.  And as in Dr. Fagan’s case, it's usually not great.  Still pay out of pocket expenses, and often forced to go in-network to awkwardly be seen by peers/bosses.  So even though we pretty much live at the hospital, barely get to have lives, serve the community with everything we got -- we are still stiffed on good care.\n\nAverage American would be frightened to hear that we do not get routinely tested for covid.  I have never been tested.  No temperature checks.  And PPE was de-prioritized for us at the pandemic apex because we’re “younger”.\n\nNo overtime pay whatsoever.  No hazard pay whatsoever. [Look at how NYU gaslighted their residents when they requested it](https://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/mark-chiusano/coronavirus-covid-19-hazard-pay-essential-workers-hospitals-new-york-1.43875887).\n\nAs practicing doctors administering care to hundreds upon hundreds of patients in a year — we get paid less than an entry level Chipotle worker.  And even if we wanted to go work at Chipotle to help pay our insane amount of student debt - we can’t per a draconian contract and unreasonable work hour expectations.  [Here is an account of a physician resident living in their vehicle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/gdw9du/broke_er_resident_living_in_my_car/).\n\nWe’re abused, plain and simple.  Meanwhile, [hospital CEOs profit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2019/06/26/top-u-s-non-profit-hospitals-ceos-are-racking-up-huge-profits/), even in non-profit academic hospitals.  Some make up to [$25M a year](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/10/22/banner-health-dominates-in-ranking-of-valleys.html) — and multiple hospital systems have pushed for cuts to residency salary that THEY DO NOT PAY!  It’s insane.  [This is a viral video of an admin in NYC talking down to frightened residents](https://streamable.com/9pfvps).\n\nBut we have a weak union, a weak AMA, and we can’t strike because it would mean breaking our most [sacred oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) of never abandoning a patient.  [The MBAs that now run run the hospital](https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/private-equity-selling-medical-residencies-for-profit.html) use this as our weakness to keep further abusing us.\n\nIn 2019, Hahnemann Hospital (Drexel) decided to close shop to sell the buildings and all 550 physician residents were screwed.  But worst of all, the hospital AUCTIONED the 550 resident slots ... [for $55 million dollars](https://whyy.org/articles/hahnemann-residency-programs-draw-winning-bid-of-55m-from-local-health-systems/).  Yes, they went about selling resident slots that were tax-payer funded.\n\nThe hospital industrial complex has grown out of control with greed and abuse, and physician residents are at the very bottom of the totem pole.  If you have the means, please help fight for us.  Spread the word, tell your legislators, [tell the AMA](https://twitter.com/amermedicalassn), [tell the ACGME](https://twitter.com/acgme) (governing body who is supposed to protect us), tell your friends what they do to us.  And mind you, all of this abuse is happening DURING A PANDEMIC.  [When 1 in 7 of all Covid-19 cases are healthcare workers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/17/health-care-workers-make-up-one-seven-covid-19-cases-recorded-globally-who-says/)!\n\nA society is only strong as its healers are strong.  Too many residents like Dr. Fagan, a true hero, have been abused by greedy forces.\n\n**UPDATE**:  Wow, I am blown away by the support for Dr. Fagan and residents as a whole.  Thank you, thank you.

Pritzker announced Thursday the forgiveness and expungement of about 500,000 criminal cannabis cases.\"\n\n“Pritzker said he issued pardons for 9,210 low-level cannabis convictions, while Illinois State Police have wiped clean more than 492,000 non-felony cannabis-related arrest records.”\n\n“The actions by Pritzker and state police is mandated by the Illinois law that legalized the licensed sale of marijuana starting in 2020. The intent of the law is to reduce the impact of the war on drugs on minorities, who were disproportionately arrested and locked up for cannabis crimes”\n\n“We will never be able to fully remedy the depth of that damage,” Pritzker said. “But we can govern with the courage to admit the mistakes of our past and the decency to set a better path forward.\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\"State Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Maywood, applauded the expungement and pardons, but said it was only a small step forward.\"\n\n“As we near the end of the first year of Illinois’ new legal cannabis industry, I am heartened by the progress we have made towards undoing the harms dealt by the failed war on drugs,” Toi Hutchinson, senior advisor to the governor for cannabis control, said in a statement\"\n\n\"Hutchinson added that none of the other 11 states that have legalized recreational cannabis have taken the step Illinois has taken, by removing low-level and non-violent cannabis-related arrest records.\"\n\n“Dismantling decades’ worth of criminal justice atrocities will take years. That’s evidenced by how this country handles cannabis,” Lightford said. “We must never stop chipping away at that painful history. I’m proud of these critical first steps.”\n\n[https://chicago.suntimes.com/cannabis/2020/12/31/22208659/cannabis-marijuana-illinois-expunge-pardon-pritzker-legal-pot](https://chicago.suntimes.com/cannabis/2020/12/31/22208659/cannabis-marijuana-illinois-expunge-pardon-pritzker-legal-pot)"

Help us keep it unlocked by reporting comments that violate our rules. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n* Do NOT make threats of violence towards anyone.\n* Do NOT call for violence against any person, including the shooter. Saying you hope he rots in jail is fine, saying you want the inmates to run a train on him is not. \n* Do NOT doxx anyone who has not been publicly named by the mainstream media, that includes not doxxing the family members of the shooter, victims, or other users that you are arguing with in this thread.\n\nReport comments that break these three rules. Let's keep this thread open for civil discussion."

He walked down the middle of the street towards the police with a weapon and his hands up. You can hear people yelling \"he's the shooter\". \n\nRegardless of arguments about self-defense or coordination with police, it would still make more sense to take him into custody and collect evidence. If the cops are on his side, get photos or documentation of his injuries to show it was, in fact, self-defense. Or, at the very least, put him in a police station where protesters can't get to him. Letting him walk past you in this situation helps literally no one."

Now a unanimous SCOTUS decision, effective immediately, gives them access to the most important financial records in that investigation."

Overall it is a pretty cool place to live and is super affordable. \n\nLived in Omaha for two years for work and was pleasantly surprised by Nebraska.  Compared to many places, Nebraska is affordable and really wholesome.  From my experience Nebraska has that true mid-west nice vibe going for it and the majority of people that I came to know where super nice.\n\n   \nAlso Omaha/Lincoln areas bandwagon super hard.  Any new hip trend is picked up pretty quickly farm to table, micro-distilleries, craft beer, you name it they have it.\n\nFor perspective to any large city person reading this who would disregard Nebraska as a place to live.  You can get a \\~1600sqft 3 bed 2 bath house in a top 10 school district in west Omaha (really nice area) for around $200k.  When I lived in west Omaha I saw two 200+ house neighborhoods be built in around 2 years.       \n\nGo Big Red!"

Its just people bickering over the score like a football game with little concern for the country at this point. \n\nThe real situation is we know Haiti is fucked up. White imperialism fucked us up but you can only blame white imperialism for so long. At the end of the day there will never be positive progress even if white people ceased to exist tomorrow, there are too many fractures within our society. Ask a haitian about black peoples capacity for cruelty and they will tell you that race doesn't matter - black white or milat they will abuse you all the same if they are the leader of haiti. I am part of the papa doc diaspora era, and my parents actually love Papa doc, because even though they had family members and friends chopped apart by the Tonton Macoute and fled with nothing on their backs, at least Papa Doc provided the catalyst to get them out of that god forsaken country and live somewhere where they could at least live in peace.  \n\nEvery time Haiti is brought up people just want to obsess about race because its an important element, but quite frankly it doesn't do shit. In a country where the wealth gap is so enormous and so many people live in abject destitution, racial equality pledges will never yield any results - imperialists would never provide more funds out of a political obligation (and they probably shouldn't tbh), and there is just simply not enough juice to squeeze out of the few milats and foreigners that make up the upper echelon of Haitian society. The problem is so big and complex that is feels like screaming into the void. You need to let actual Haitians lead the rebuilding efforts, but actual Haitians have given a lot of reason to not be trusted so rebuilding efforts are always stalled by that reluctance. One would want to give a democratically elected leader a chance, but if the vast majority of the country is in abject poverty and fear and hatred rule the minds of many would you trust the leader that they try to elect? You need to bolster and empower the few remaining people willing to create jobs in Haiti - but how far can you really empower a class of people that are likely western textile firms and Lebanese multimillionaires whose work looks awfully similar to what the only industry Haiti has ever been able to support (agricultural slavery, or slavery with extra steps). You need to somehow channel the only real resource that Haiti has ever had - millions of young people who speak french and have real capacity for incredible ingenuity and intelligence,  but people far smarter than me have no idea how to channel that energy other than lackadaisical rebuilding efforts, or political gangsterism. \n\nI know I cry about providing solutions, and I just provided no solutions. Thats the funny nature of this beast. I just wish people looked at Haiti with a different perspective instead of always painting it with the same two tones of paint."

He later told Internal Affairs investigators that he gave the order to protect the identities of plainclothes officers in a dangerous line of work.\n\nBut several of them were later accused of fabricating evidence, robbing store owners of cash and merchandise, and lying on search warrants to cover their tracks, as documented in a 2010 Pulitzer Prize-winning series by the Philadelphia Daily News. Only one of those officers was fired.\n\nBologna received only a suspension for “failing to properly supervise” and was given a different command, overseeing the 19th Police District in West Philadelphia.\n\nThere, he managed a tactical squad that would rack up scores of misconduct complaints.\n\nIn just one 18-month period between 2014 and 2015, his officers were the subject of a combined 25 civilian complaints and 37 departmental offenses — including claims of physical abuse, thinly supported car stops and home searches, vandalism, threats, and theft, the news outlet City & State Pennsylvania reported in 2018."

I was told numerous times I could have died by the medical professionals who treated me. In fact, had I been a child I *would have most definitely* died.\n\nSo let me tell you this:\n\nI don't care how cute you think your dog is. I don't care how good he or she is with you, with your nieces, with your children or with your grandma. At the end of the day they are animals. Training helps–and a lot–to curb some of the more aggressive and potentially dangerous instincts they may have. But that's not the end of your responsibility as a dog owner.\n\nIf you're going to adopt a dog, pick one you can manage both **mentally and physically.** If your dog's breed is stubborn and independent, be aware you'll spend the rest of your life having to keep an extra eye on them when you're out and about. And if you only weigh 110 pounds and get a Rottweiler, I suggest you think again.\n\nIn my case,  I'm starting to see signs that I may be developing PTSD after my attack (can't get formally diagnosed after at least an month of recurrent symptoms). This is *serious*. Dogs aren't accessories to your life and you shouldn't treat them like that."

                    "text": "Rapper Lil Wayne was charged Tuesday in Florida with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a federal offense that carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nDocuments filed in Miami federal court say the rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., had a gun and ammunition on Dec. 23 of last year despite knowing he had the previous felony on his record.\n\nAuthorities said the 38-year-old rapper acknowledged owning the gold-plated handgun after his luggage was searched upon arriving in Miami on a private plane. A search warrant, first reported by the Miami Herald at the time, said Carter told investigators the gun was a Father’s Day gift.\n\nCarter’s attorney, Howard Srebnick, said in an email that there are legal questions about whether mere possession of a weapon by a felon not judged to be dangerous fits the definition of a crime.\n\n“Carter is charged with possessing a gold-plated handgun in his luggage on a private plane. There is no allegation that he ever fired it, brandished it, used it or threatened to use it,” Srebnick said. “There is no allegation that he is a dangerous person.”\n\nInvestigators also reported finding suspected illegal drugs in the luggage, but Carter has not been charged with a drug offense.\n\nAn initial court date on the weapons charge is set for Dec. 11 in Miami federal court.\n\nThe charge stems from a weapons conviction of Carter in New York more than a decade ago, for which he was sentenced to eight months in prison. Convicted felons are barred under federal law from owning firearms.\n\nAs Lil Wayne, Carter has sold over 120 million records, has won five Grammys and numerous other music awards. He owns a home in Miami Beach and is CEO of his own record label, Young Money Entertainment."

We were able to make an example out of him because he stuck out, but there are quite a few more executives and lobbyists and so forth that deserve a fucking cell.\n\nEdit: all I'm saying is Shkreli's sentencing did nothing to change the pharmaceutical pricing scheme in the US. And furthermore, we didn't solve the problem just because we got one executive 'real good' with a seven year sentence."

Sucked big time and am just glad no one was injured like in this story.\n\nEdit: wow lots of comments/upvotes. To answer a few questions - it happened a few days before thanksgiving in the US (mid November) and we’re still trying to deal with it. Basically I and my insurance company have been trying to get the city’s insurance to pay and they’re refusing. Claiming sovereign or qualified immunity bc the cop was “responding to a call” even though he told my renter after it happened that he “must have dozed off” bc he didn’t remember anything. It’s basically come down to my insurance is going to have to sue theirs. But my insurance is also trying to lowball us + we have to pay the deductible which means I’ll see little money. My renters are out a car and had to be removed from the home bc it was condemned by the city... and they didn’t have renters insurance so they’re double fucked. All around a terrible situation."

The black population of Marshalltown is practically nil.  The white community is largely poor-is and undereducated-ish, IMO, as most of the college educated young folks have move to Des Moines, 45 minutes away.\n\nI have a friend who always says \"I've been to Marshalltown twice.

Now a bunch of grumpy old people who don't understand why prosperity left their town behind, complain that there are \"too many Mexicans\" working at the only local restaurants they have.\n\nI only moved to Marshalltown to find work closer to my fiancée, and as soon as I could leave, I did.

That's also why he's been using disinformation to push a false narrative that vote by mail is rife with fraud. It is not.\n\nA few facts about vote by mail:\n\n* Americans have used vote by mail/absentee voting since the Civil War.\n\n* In 2016, 25% of voters voted by mail.\n\n* Colorado uses universal vote by mail and is considered to have the most secure elections in the country.\n\n* Mail-in ballots have bar codes to prevent duplicates, and every ballot requires a signature that is checked in a database to prevent fraud.\n\n* To receive a ballot, you must be a registered voter.\n\n* Mail-in voting creates a paper trail that can then be audited after the election.\n\nVote by mail is secure. Trump is lying when he says it isn't. That's why the RNC is mailing their voters urging them to request absentee ballots. \n\nAnd lastly, experts this year are predicting that as many as 70% of all votes cast could be by mail. We need the USPS to be funded and we need states to also have sufficient election funding if we want to have a fair election this November.\n\nFFS people, this isn't partisan. If you are Republican, you should want this and if you are Democrat you should want this. It's INSANE that this is a partisan football and that Republicans aren't speaking out about it."

As you can tell, I've loved every minute of my 20 years as host of Hardball.\"\n\n>\"Every morning I read the papers and I'm gung-ho to get to work. Not many people have had this privilege. I love working with my producers and the discussions we have over how to report the news. And I love having this connection with you, the good people who watch. I've learned who you are, bumping into you on the sidewalk, or waiting at an airport and saying hello. \"You're like me!\" I hear from your kids and grandchildren who say 'My dad loves you' or 'My grandmother loves you' 'Or my husband loved you until the end.\"\n\n>\"But after conversation with MSNBC, I decided tonight would be my last Hardball, so let me tell you why. The younger generation is out there ready to take the reins. We see them in politics, in the media, and fighting for their causes. They're improving the workplace. We're talking here about better standards than we grew up with. Fairer standards.\"\n\n>\"A lot of it has to with how we talk to each other. Compliments on a woman's appearance that some men, including me, may have once incorrectly thought were OK, were never OK. Not then and certainly not today. And for making such comments in the past, I'm sorry.\"\n\n>\"I'm very proud of the work I've done here. Long before I went on television I worked for years in politics. I was a newspaper columnist and an author. I'm working on another book, I'll continue to write and talk about politics and cheer on my producers and crew here in Washington and New York and my MSNBC colleagues. They will continue to produce great journalism in the years ahead.\"\n\n>\"And for those of you who have gotten in the habit of watching Hardball every night, I hope you're going to miss me, because I'm going to miss you. But remember Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. We'll always have Hardball. So let's not say goodbye, but til we meet again.\""

Okay, they warned us and we didn’t disperse, so that wasn’t unexpected. \n\nBut during several days of protests, three of us were sitting on the steps of our apartment building in a relatively quiet neighborhood in downtown D.C., chatting and not protesting at all, when a D.C. police car drove up to us and rolled down its window. We looked at them and expected them to ask us questions or tell us to get back inside, but without saying a word they just shot tear gas at us and drove off.\n\nWe scrambled back into the building, but I managed to get the number of the car and filed a complaint with the D.C. Police Department. Fifty years later, I’m still awaiting the results of their investigation."

Where I live it’s basically like life was 9-10 months ago, except add in some folks wearing masks out and about and in stores. Numbers of people are the same, restaurants are packed, schools are open. So interesting to see these differences\n\nEdit- I went to Lowe’s today to grab some stuff to fix my fence. I know, some of you will think I’m a monster, but listen, that fence had to be fixed. And also, like I said, it’s basically like normal around here with shopping, retail, etc. I saw basically everyone wearing a mask. Lots of people in the store. I was impressed! But then I got over to the contractor side, and it switched to basically no one was wearing a mask. 🤷‍♂️"

We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. \n\n“We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”\n\nElliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”\n\n\nElliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. \n\nI have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. \n\nEven with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”\n\nThe statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising. The hospital is already at capacity.”"

This has been an incredibly stressful time for area healthcare workers, as it has been across the world. I genuinely cannot put into words how incredibly frustrating it is to deal with so much self-sabotage and ignorance from the community. I genuinely don’t think that I have had a single day at work that I haven’t had to try to convince someone that Covid should be taken seriously. \n\nIt has finally started to really hit the area hard which is not good news. We have an incredibly high rate of heart disease, COPD, and obesity. I’ve been saying since December that our area will get absolutely wrecked if it gets a foothold. My sister works at the health dept. with Amber and cries most days. They have physicians in the area that are opposing mask mandates. The day they announced the mandate, my sister had to be escorted to her car by police because people were being so belligerent. \n\nWe have done nothing but serve the community for years, myself the better part of a decade. That apparently earns no goodwill or trust from them. I am genuinely disgusted with the area and think daily how nice it would be to be able to speak to them collectively and try to explain why this is happening and that it is the fault of people like them. Alternatively, it would be nice to line them all up and, in an orderly fashion, slap the actual shit out of them."

Hopefully this becomes the first time they're held accountable. \n\n\nHere's some excerpts from the article I linked\n\n>In an ongoing suit against Portland Place trustees in 2017, the McCloskeys say they are entitled to a 1,143-square-foot triangle of lawn in front of property that is set aside as common ground in the neighborhood’s indenture.\n\n>It was that patch of green protesters saw when they filed through the gate. **Mark McCloskey said in an affidavit that he has defended the patch before by pointing a gun at a neighbor who had tried to cut through it.**\n\n\n.\n\n\n> In 2013, he destroyed bee hives placed just outside of the mansion’s northern wall by the neighboring Jewish Central Reform Congregation and left a note saying he did it, and if the mess wasn’t cleaned up quickly he would seek a restraining order and attorneys fees. The congregation had planned to harvest the honey and pick apples from trees on its property for Rosh Hashanah.\n\n\n\n>“The children were crying in school,” Rabbi Susan Talve said. “It was part of our curriculum.”\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n>They filed a lawsuit in St. Louis circuit court to try to force the trustees to enforce the neighborhood rules as written. The McCloskeys dismissed the claim, but the judge would not let them refile an amended version because it “failed to allege a justiciable controversy.”\n\n>The McCloskeys appealed all the way to the state Supreme Court to try to make the judge allow them to refile their case, but the effort failed.\n\n>One of the rules prohibited unmarried people from living together. **Several neighbors said it was because the McCloskeys didn’t want gay couples living on the block.** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n>Mark McCloskey sued a former employer for wrongful termination and his sister, father and his father’s caretaker for defamation"

And who can forget it! —even after he is proved right and the emergency is over.\n\n>That particular voice may sound vaguely Southern or Southwestern, but it is specifically Appalachian in origin. It originated in the mountains of West Virginia, in the coal country, in Lincoln County, so far up in the hollows that, as the saying went, “they had to pipe in daylight.” In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s this up-hollow voice drifted down from on high, from over the high desert of California, down, down, down, from the upper reaches of the Brotherhood into all phases of American aviation. It was amazing. It was Pygmalion in reverse. Military pilots and then, soon, airline pilots, pilots from Maine and Massachusetts and the Dakotas and Oregon and everywhere else, began to talk in that poker-hollow West Virginia drawl, or as close to it as they could bend their native accents. It was the drawl of the most righteous of all the possessors of the right stuff: Chuck Yeager."

An Aurora citizen reported to police that McClain was acting suspiciously and that they thought no one was in danger. The three police officers that were involved in the incident [1]claimed their body cameras were knocked off during the struggle with him. According to an attorney representing McClain's family, when police arrived, they immediately apprehended and slammed him into a wall. On the way to the hospital he suffered cardiac arrest. McClain was taken off life support 7 days later, resulting in his death. An autopsy report was inconclusive and could not determine the cause of death.[2][3][4][5] \n  \nEdit: [here is a petition calling for justice](https://www.change.org/p/adams-county-district-attorney-justice-for-elijah-mcclain-2)"

My mom said he looked so drastically bad and the change happened in a day or two. He was in the hospital for two days and then passed. When I went to see him he couldn’t breathe at all and his fever was really bad. He had all of the COVID symptoms. \n\nIt didn’t occur to us until all of this starting getting serious and the quarantine happened, but we think he might have had it. It’s super sad when I think about it. Is there even a way to go back and confirm this? The doctors said the cause of death was heart failure. He was sick for two days and then died and I don’t think there was an autopsy or anything."

Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose.\n\nThey conducted the interim analysis when they got 94 cases in their trials. Can someone calculate how many cases did they get in their placebo group and how many in the vaccine group, for the result to be >90% efficacy?\n\n> Based on current projections we expect to produce globally **up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021**.\n\nSince vaccination requires two doses, 1.3 billion doses would protect 650 million people by the end of 2021, assuming no wastage.

The department did not release any other information about the officers and Carson referred further questions to OPA.\n\n>Andrew Myerberg, OPA’s civilian director, said in a phone interview late Friday that the department notified his office about two officers on Thursday evening, and an internal investigation case was initiated early Friday.\n\n>“We learned about this in an email last night,” Myerberg said. “There’s a picture that circulated on social media of the two officers at the protest rally. So, yes, we believe they were there, but we don’t know all the facts yet, so that’s why we’re doing the investigation.”\n\n>The OPA will try to determine “what role the officers played” at the D.C. protests, including whether they participated with the mob in the deadly riot that breached the Capitol, he said.\n\n>“The fundamental question will be, ‘Is being present at the rally in and of itself a violation of department policy?’” Myerberg said. “And I just don’t know that yet. I think it really depends on what they did and what their role was in those events.”\n\n>OPA investigators will also seek to find out if any other Seattle officers may have attended or participated in Wednesday’s events, and if so, to what extent, he said.\n\n>Seattle Police Officers Guild Mike Solan did not immediately return a message seeking comment late Friday.\n\n>Diaz’s statement comes after [a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/congress-set-to-confirm-bidens-electoral-win-over-trump/) on Wednesday, protesting President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory, interrupting congressional debate and marching through the building, ransacking many areas.

He noted that in 2009, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, recused himself from a case involving Swiss Bank UBS, a prior client.\n\n>But Green said he could not recall a case where agents were told to take no further action on a matter involving an incoming attorney general’s former client without some kind of explanation. “Why would you just stop?” he asked.\n\nCan't say \"But Obama!\" because Holder actually did the right thing it seems. \n\n...well I say you can't do a whataboutism cause it flies in the face of logic, but I'm sure someone will try."

Wasn't the ex-boyfriend already in custody? On what grounds was that warrant approved? If the bad guy dealer ex-boyfriend was believed to be there, wait until he comes out and take him into custody without breaking down the door.\n\nThere's a whole lot of things that are shitty about the events that led up to the shooting. And just charging the cops glosses over that fact.\n\nSo, I'm not a cop. I was a Soldier and I have conducted searches and taken people into custody. And we always had Rules of Engagement. The RoE always said 'Positively Identify the target before you pull the trigger.'\n\nThe current boyfriend that fired at \"home invaders\" was not shot. So the cops were using the \"spray and pray\" method of marksmanship.\n\nIMHO, it was a bad shooting. But also points out that the legal system implicitly supports cops trying to act like Rambos.\n\nEdit to add. I'm running out patience and compassion to explain why this was a bad shoot and a bad warrant... If you reply to me with an apologistic post about how the cops were in the right, and the warrant was good,  I'll just reply with a  down vote, unless there's something really interesting in your post."

During the war in Cuba, Roosevelt wrote a letter to the press to change public opinion to demand the Secretary of War reverse his position and allow sick soldiers with malaria and yellow fever to be returned to the United States to be quarantined. It worked. Troops with the disease were quartined on Long Island and probably saved hundreds of lives. Roosevelt later was put up for the medal of honor which was then rejected by the same Secretary of War.\n\nEdit: coincidence not irony.
