Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” \n\n2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”\n\n2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”\n\n2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”\n\n2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” \n\n2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”\n\n2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” \n\n2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”\n\n2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”\n\n2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”\n\n2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”"

                    "text": "A powerful statement by Mattis that makes you understand why he was revered by the military. Here's the text:\n\n**IN UNION THERE IS STRENGTH**\n\nI have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled. The words “Equal Justice Under Law” are carved in the pediment of the United States Supreme Court. This is precisely what protesters are rightly demanding. It is a wholesome and unifying demand—one that all of us should be able to get behind. We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values—our values as people and our values as a nation.\n\nWhen I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.\n\nWe must reject any thinking of our cities as a “battlespace” that our uniformed military is called upon to “dominate.” At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors. Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict—a false conflict—between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part. Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.\n\nJames Madison wrote in Federalist 14 that “America united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat.” We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose. And it starts by guaranteeing that all of us are equal before the law.\n\nInstructions given by the military departments to our troops before the Normandy invasion reminded soldiers that “The Nazi slogan for destroying us…was ‘Divide and Conquer.’ Our American answer is ‘In Union there is Strength.’” We must summon that unity to surmount this crisis—confident that we are better than our politics.\n\nDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.\n\nWe can come through this trying time stronger, and with a renewed sense of purpose and respect for one another. The pandemic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of the community. Americans in hospitals, grocery stores, post offices, and elsewhere have put their lives on the line in order to serve their fellow citizens and their country. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. At the same time, we must remember Lincoln’s “better angels,” and listen to them, as we work to unite.\n\nOnly by adopting a new path—which means, in truth, returning to the original path of our founding ideals—will we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.\n\nJames Mattis"

                    "text": "Esper played his political hand well -  technically he did not ban the confederate flag outright, he outlined what flags are allowable.  There is no mention of the words \"Confederate Flag\" or \"Ban\" in the Memo.\n\nSource of memo: [https://news.usni.org/2020/07/17/secdef-esper-memo-on-displaying-flags-on-u-s-bases](https://news.usni.org/2020/07/17/secdef-esper-memo-on-displaying-flags-on-u-s-bases) \n\n \n\nSUBJECT: Public Display or Depiction of Flags in the Department of Defense\n\nThe mission of the Department of Defense is to provide a combat-ready  military force to deter conflict, and, should deterrence fail, to  prevail in war. Accomplishing this mission depends on our most important  resource – our Service members and civilian employees. Supporting our  people requires mutual respect, responsibility, and accountability.\n\nFlags are powerful symbols, particularly in the military community  for whom flags embody common mission, common histories, and the special,  timeless bond of warriors. As Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, a  veteran of the Second World War, once wrote about the United States  flag: “It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious  tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our  aspirations.” We wear this flag on our sleeves; we honor it prominently  on parade fields; we carry it into combat; and, we drape it over the  coffins of those who have given their lives for our Nation.\n\nWe must always remain focused on what unifies us: our sworn oath to  the Constitution and our shared duty to defend the Nation. I am  committed to fielding the most powerful military force the world has  known by strengthening the bonds of our most valuable resource -our\n\npeople. That is why we honor the American flag, which is the  principal flag we are authorized and encouraged to display. The flags we  fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and  discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and  rejecting divisive symbols.\n\nConsequently, in addition to the American flag, Service members and  civilian employees are authorized to display or depict representational  flags that promote unity and esprit de corps, including:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Flags of U.S. States and Territories and the District of Columbia; \n* Military Service flags;\n* Flag or General Officer flags;\n* Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian flags;\n* Senior Executive Service (SES) and Military Department-specific SES flags;\n* The POW /MIA flag;\n* Flags of other countries, for which the United States is an ally or partner, or for official protocol purposes;\n* Flags of organizations in which the United States is a member ( e.g., NATO); and\n* Ceremonial, command, unit, or branch flags or guidons.\n\nThis guidance applies to public displays or depictions of flags by  Service members and civilian employees in all Department of Defense work  places, common access areas, and public areas, including, but not  limited to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Office buildings, facilities, naval vessels, aircraft, government  vehicles, hangars, garages, ready rooms, conference rooms, individual  offices, cubicles, storage rooms, tool and equipment rooms, workshops,  break rooms, kitchens/galleys, recreational areas, commissaries, Navy  and Marine Corps and Army and Air Force exchanges, and  heads/latrines/restrooms – including property and buildings off  installation leased by the Department;\n* Sensitive compartmented information facilities and other secure facilities;\n* Open-bay barracks, berthing areas, and common areas of barracks and bachelor quarters;\n* School houses and training facilities; and\n* All spaces or items in public or plain view, such as the outside  areas of any Department of Defense buildings and government-operated or  public-private venture housing (e.g., parking lots, yards, gazebos, or  porches).\n\nThe public display or depiction of unauthorized flags in museum  exhibits, state-issued license plates, grave sites, memorial markers,  monuments, educational displays, historical displays, or works of art,  where the nature of the display or depiction cannot reasonably be viewed  as endorsement of the flag by the Department of Defense, is not  prohibited.\n\nWhat has always united us remains clear – our common mission, our  oath to support and defend the Constitution, and our American flag. With  this change in policy, we will further improve the morale, cohesion,  and readiness of the force in defense of our great Nation.\n\n(signed)\n\nMark Esper"

Graham to apparently contemplate illegal behavior, but his suggestion undermines the integrity of our elections and the faith of the American people in our democracy.” He alleges, “Under the guise of rooting out election fraud, it looks like Graham is suggesting committing it. That is unacceptable, and Sen. Graham should step down from his chairmanship immediately.”\n\nHey Republicans, I found the real voter fraud right here."

Lee.\"**\n\nLee's \"[complex](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/making-sense-of-robert-e-lee-85017563/)\" views on slavery spilled over into middle/lower class racial sentiments toward freedmen in the post-war south.  The lazy notion that \"I don't particularly *like* slavery/segregation... but what else are we supposed to do with such an 'inferior' race???\"\n\nPeople like Lee and some of his contemporaries were at least genuine in that sentiment.  The vast majority of everyone else from then until now used/use it as an excuse to just continue being racists.  It gave poor whites a feeling of superiority over someone, regardless of the fact that they were an afterthought to the wealthy landowners in the south, save for when they needed to use them as political pawns to keep their grip on power.\n\nFor a few hundred years, it was beaten into the brain of every white commoner that if slaves/blacks were given equality, they'd use it to rape and pillage and oppress the white man for their plight.\n\nThe grand irony of that is, it was essentially an admission that slaves/blacks were every bit as human as them, in that they would/might have a very human response to centuries of enslavement and horrific brutality.\n\nFuckin' slavery... another tool in history's toolbox for a handful of rich sociopaths to get richer, and then they used the fallout to keep the lowly peons fighting among themselves for another 2 centuries.  It is so maddening.\n\nEdit:  Humbled by the gold and these new fangled awards I’ve received, kind redditors!"

In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed."

                    "text": "> House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) announced on Friday that lawmakers would be voting next month on a bill to decriminalize marijuana federally, leaving regulation up to the states. The vote would mark the first time either chamber of Congress ever voted on decriminalization of marijuana.\n\n> In a Friday email to lawmakers, Clyburn said the House would take up the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, first introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. The MORE Act would also expunge prior marijuana-related convictions, and impose a 5-percent sales tax which the federal government would reinvest in communities harmed by the “War on Drugs” through the creation of an Opportunity Trust Fund.\n\nInteresting development. It previously cleared the House Judiciary Committee in 2019 (24-10 votes)."

I got to see Poland for myself recently, specifically the places where Nazis turned the whole country into one gigantic extermination machine. \n\nI’d like these new 2020 Nazis, neo-Nazis, assholes playing at Nazis, all types of Nazis etc. to see what Nazism truly meant, what it truly wrought. 1400 people murdered in a pit the size of half a tennis court. A mountain of ash and human teeth still intact to this day. Thousands of glasses, gold teeth, dishes, suitcases, shoes, all ripped away from human beings, piled up ten feet high and now just distant whispers of life. A baby drowned in the latrine seconds after birth, not out of cruelty, but as an act of mercy. POWs left outside in below zero temperatures and sprayed with water hoses who would then have their frozen limbs shattered the next morning. Scratches on the walls of the gas chambers. Perfected, uninterrupted, dehumanizing murder. \n\nLet them see that. Let them hear from the people who escaped, the mother who had to leave one child behind. Let them learn what the smell was like. \n\nThis is America. Everything Nazism stands for, we stand against. Everything they wanted in the world, we have rejected and survived - a Jewish man might be the nominee for a major American political party. That’s one giant fuck you to Hitler. My existence is one giant fuck you to every goddamn Nazi in the world. They will always lose, and we, good, decent people who care about each other, will always win. \n\nSo yeah, I guess, uh, fuck Nazis, you know?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards!

Tell them you want to dismantle the predatory lending market that targets minority communities. Tell them you want to revamp the education system, from the primary grades to post-secondary opportunities, increase prosperity for all willing to put in the hard work. \n\nTell the voters what you want to do and how they can help you accomplish it, tell them they need to continue to support in 2022 and 2024.\n\nEdit. Thanks for gold kind benefactor. I'm going to pay it forward in this thread as there's been several excellent replies.\n\nIf the Democratic party continues to embrace the centrist bipartisan approach it will be an extreme uphill battle into 22 and 24. If it wasn't for the pandemic and the massive draw towards absentee ballot there may not have been party representation to take this win from Donald Trump."

It’s a shame to make the science so complicated.”\n\n> Scientists also continue to express dismay at the apparent political interference. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released a statement Wednesday saying that such orders to cancel funding “will undermine the integrity of science funding and public trust. We urge Congress to use its oversight authority to ensure that the integrity of government science agencies is not compromised.”"

I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.”\n\nJesus."

Beyond the fact it makes it easier to vote (not having to take time off work, find someone to drive you if you are unable to drive, hurry to get to the polls after work, stand in line, etc, etc), it makes for much more informed voting. You can sit down at you computer and research each issue, each candidate, and make informed voting decisions vs just selecting based on the letter next to the name, or tossing a coin on certain issues.\n\nNot supporting vote by mail is support for voter suppression and uninformed voters."

He’s a ratfucker. Which is why Fox News soon picked him up, and then the NRA, who needed a ratfucker who could keep theor mouth shut about all of the ratfuckery going on in their organization.\n\nBut, surprise, Ollie suddenly develops a conscience and calls out the NRA for misusing funds as soon as he becomes president, leading to a fracture among members. Some sided with North, and some sided with the previous leadership. They’ve been at each others throats for a year now, and the NRA has been bleeding money because no one wants to “donate” to them anymore.\n\nI wish I had kept the NRA pamphlet that came with my handgun instead of throwing it in the trash. It might become a rare piece of Americana\n\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/usvsplastic"

Anyone who went was a sucker'” (1/2)\n\n> Regarding Trump's July 4th military parade, during a planning session at the White House after seeing the Bastille Day parade in 2017, the President said regarding the inclusion of \"wounded guys\" \"that's not a good look\" \"Americans don't like that,\" source confirms. (2/2)\n\nAwkward for Fox. By now, this should be pretty evident the story is true. The AP, Washington Post, & FoxNews have all confirmed portions, if not the entire story. But, we don’t need this to know it’s true. Trump’s own public actions and words since he became a candidate speak loudly enough by themselves!"

Governments trying to rush are just doing it because they don’t like to deal with people being pissed off at them. Donald trump has taken no responsibility for the results of the response as a country, though he says it’s the best response ever.  He uses it as a political weapon.

Not my state.”\n\nHoping the voters in Kentucky see this and vote Amy McGrath in the way they elected Andy Beshear as Governor. McConnell’s time as a senator should be over. We don’t need to bail HIM out any longer!"

From the article:\n\n\nTrump’s decision to sideline DOT acting IG Mitch Behm (who has 17 years of experience with OIG) was lost in the shuffle of outrage following the announcement that Trump planned to fire the State Department IG, but potential conflicts of interest abound. The most high profile is the DOT OIG’s review of allegations that Secretary Chao gave Senator McConnell’s constituents special treatment and helped steer millions of federal dollars to Kentucky as he is facing low approval ratings and a tough reelection bid. \n\nAs Senate Majority Leader, McConnell was integral to the Senate’s consideration of Howard Elliott’s nomination to lead PHMSA. Now McConnell will also be instrumental to Eric Soskin’s potential confirmation as permanent IG. Soskin is a Justice Department trial lawyer “involved in some hot-button immigration and civil rights cases.” These moves will leave oversight of the Chao-McConnell  investigation in the hands of Trump administration officials  who McConnell has effectively endorsed. In the case of Ellinott, as Secretary, Chao maintains authority to fire him from PHMSA. As CREW has pointed out before, this situation poses a huge conflict of interest. How can the American people expect transparency and accountability when the watchdogs must pass a loyalty test from the President and be approved by officials impacted by their investigations?"

They don't want people who work for a living, who are busy with one or more jobs and raising a family, to have the convenience of filling out their ballot at home and dropping it in the mail (instead of potentially standing in a long line for hours to fill out a ballot in person).\n\nFortunately, this really isn't up to him.

As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!\n\nI am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. \n\nMainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. \n\nI support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. \n\nAs the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.\n\nI also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. \n\nI helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. \n\nMy nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:\n\n* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country\n\n* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country\n\n* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years\n\n* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby\n\n* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom\n\n* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan\n\n* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance\nFounding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.\n\n* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. \n\n* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. \n\nI am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy. \n\n**Check out my website and social media:**\n\n* https://betsysweet.com\n\n* Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/betsysweetME)\n\n* Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/betsysweetme/) \n\n* Twitter (https://twitter.com/BetsySweetME)\n\n* Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmK7as5-nWW3_khgQtiLyQ) \n\nImage: https://i.imgur.com/19dgPzv.jpg",

A plaintiff who prevails in the lawsuit is entitled to reasonable attorney fees, and a defendant in an individual suit is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for defending any frivolous claims. Qualified immunity ~~and a defendant’s good faith but erroneous belief in the lawfulness of his or her conduct are not defenses~~ is not a defense to the civil action. The bill requires a political subdivision of the state to indemnify its employees for such a claim; except that - **if the peace officer’s employer determines the officer did not act upon a good faith and reasonable belief that the action was lawful, then the peace officer is personally liable for 5 percent of the judgment or $25,000, whichever is less, unless the judgment is uncollectible from the officer, then the officer’s employer satisfies the whole judgment.**\n\nI do think this is a step in the right direction long-term because it will force departments to instill & reinforce better De-Escalation training procedures for their officers. Not having quite the safety net will motivate the departments & unions to truly engage and enforce these procedures when on duty."

Just forgiving loans stops the bleeding for many now, but there's nothing incentivizing colleges to reduce costs if future loans just get forgiven. More education funding, sure. idk\n\nAnother thing: Charging 7% on federal loans is ridiculous. It accrues while you're in school, and if you go into forbearance during repayment, it gets added to your principal loan. So then you pay interest on top of interest. \n\nAm I a customer or a citizen to invest in? Other countries seem to invest more in their citizens than the US."

Free college is a thing. Parental leave, paid vacation. Countless things missing in most of the US are a thing in many other countries.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason why the US couldn't do the same for its people. It just comes down to whether or not the government is actually willing to provide for the people instead of the top 1%.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify, I understand all the \"free\" stuff comes out of taxes. But the point stands because the tax increase required to cover these expenses is not that large. And as Bernie points out, if the US government can find ways to essentially gift a trillion dollars to the 1% in the form of tax cuts, they can also afford to cancel student debt without raising taxes.\n\nAnd in regards to healthcare, the fact that health insurance exists in the US and is used not only for covering health care, but also paying for the salaries and office rent and benefits for all those countless thousands of insurance company workers, means that it's actually more expensive than universal healthcare would be, which would send your money almost directly to hospitals. No insurance company middle-men taking a huge cut. So you could still get the exact same health care, but also make sure you fellow man doesn't go bankrupt for life when they're hit by a car during that 1 month they were between jobs and without being able to afford insurance."

At the time Abbott made the EO to allow the two election expansions, [Texas was experiencing a massive COVID up-wave](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-updates-july-30-in-dallas-fort-worth/287-60b54ebe-f7e3-4dbe-a5a7-41149c17ab50).\n\nThe far right, which has been [rabidly furious with Greg Abbott for taking COVID-19 even minimally seriously](https://texasscorecard.com/state/fed-up-texans-plan-protest-against-king-abbott/), has [sued and sued and sued his pants off](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/columnists/grieder/article/Grieder-Abbott-learns-it-s-hard-to-keep-the-15599518.php). I really can't emphasize enough how much they openly hate him right now - QAnon and anti-vaxxer enthusiast [Allen West](https://thetexan.news/gop-chairman-calls-for-attorney-general-to-seize-harris-county-mail-in-ballot-applications/) (yes, really, *that* [Allen West](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/texas-politics/politifact/article/fact-check-texas-gop-chairman-covid-recovery-rate-15474706.php)) was overwhelmingly [elected TX GOP Chairman](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-allen-west-republican-party-chairman-20200720-v6a5ws2emnao5gejbcgogclsp4-story.html) on a stridently anti-Abbott and anti-mask platform. Several sitting [State Senators](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Greg-Abbott-has-unilaterally-directed-COVID-15548794.php) and [State Reps](https://freedomfortexas.com/uploads/blog/d55819a32e8040a7d09d92cc19a5152335b57a26.pdf) have disavowed him and said they won't listen to him anymore. Hell, even [~~6~~ 8 County GOP chapters](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Republican-committees-in-8-Texas-counties-vote-to-15404946.php) voted to censure him for his decisions to shut down bars (a shutdown that could easily be bypassed, btw).\n\nNow, regarding the executive order, Abbott's justification for closing the remote drop off sites is the usual 'Voter Fraud' bullshit. What is interesting about it is that the language in the Executive Order is almost copy-pasted word for word from the lawsuit that the far right is using to end the extended Early Voting and absentee drop off timeline. He is actively capitulating to the angriest conspiracy theorists in the party, which, in Texas GOP land, is just another Thursday.\n\n---\n\nNow, that said, given how many crazy lawsuits and EO's that have been thrown around since June, it's important for Texans to know which rules are cemented in place, which rules are under threat pending lawsuits, and which rules have been eliminated or disallowed:\n\n##Early In Person Voting\n* October 19-30 will not be touched. You will always be able to vote during these times, [per state law](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.85.htm#85.001)\n* The state may not unilaterally close Early Voting sites. Only counties may do this, [per state law](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.85.htm#85.061)\n* October 13-18 is at risk pending a case brought before the TX Supreme Court courtesy of said far right assholes.\n\n##Absentee Ballot Returns\n* You are still allowed to mail your ballot back to the county. This will not change, and is not the focus of Abbott's EO\n* The original law says that hand delivery is only allowed on Election Day (Nov. 3) at the Election Administrator's Office ([source](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.86.htm#86.006))\n* Abbott's July EO allows voters to drop off ballots to their county Elections Admin office at any time in person, assuming the office is open (source provided above)\n* Extra drop off sites aren't allowed by law, but unlike most counties, Harris & Travis County elections are run by their Clerks' Offices, and those clerk offices usually have [satellite offices](https://www.cclerk.hctx.net/ContactUs.aspx) throughout [the county](https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/). The remote sites are all located at the clerks' satellite offices. This is what Abbott is shutting down. If you aren't registered in Travis or Harris counties, your county already isn't allowed to open remote drop off sites (source: law states that ballots can only be returned to Early Voting Clerk's Office. For most counties, the EV Clerk is only in one location. Travis & Harris clerks have >1 office that serve as satellite sites).\n\n##Straight Party Ticket Voting\n* This was [outlawed in 2019](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/30/lost-texas-voters-shortcut-might-hurt-downballot-candidates-democrats/) by the GOP-controlled legislature\n* Democratic-backed groups successfully received a favorable ruling from a US District Court judge, only to be overturned by the 5th Circuit a few days later\n* As of now, straight party voting won't be on the ballot\n\n##Online Voter Registration\n* [Not allowed under TX Law](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.13.htm#13.002)\n* However, the Secretary of State's Office must now [comply with a Federal Judge's ruling](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/23/register-vote-online-texas/) that Texans who update their driver's licenses addresses online must also have their registrations updated online as well\n\nEdit: will add citations later.

These bills are stagnating in the huge trash pile of problem-solving legislation under Moscow Mitch’s desk.\n\n - shorting the census in order to block growth of representation in blue districts\n\n - plans under way in multiple Republican state legislatures to hijack the selection of electors against the will of the people’s vote if it looks like Trump is going to lose.\n\n[((**edit**)) new incidents: \n\n - [absentee ballots found in dumpster](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jcfhk7/undelivered_absentee_ballots_found_in_dumpster_in/) - culprit is a postal worker for the 40299 zipcode in Louisville KY.

We Americans who believe in principle and who value integrity in our democracy, *irrespective of party alignment*, need to vote to clean this festering cancer from our government.  Our nation is in a crisis of corruption right now.  Forget worrying about advancing the GOP agenda in this term.  This is a time for triage.  The life of our democracy is at stake.  Our democratic privileges are in peril.\n\nWe the People need to act to Purge the Republicans from the Executive and the Legislature this term so that we can clean up the foreign tampering and enact laws to shore up all the exploited loopholes where the corruption got into the system.  After we’ve removed these tumors, we can look to cleaning up and rebuildng the Republican Party next term.  For now, we just need to stem the bleeding.  \n\nI don’t think our country can survive another 4 years of this assault on the integrity of our government.\n\n*(BTW, if you’re alarmed like I am, do something.)* \n\n - *Vote.*  \n - *Get your friends and family to vote.* \n - *Join a Get Out the Vote campaign  - google that to find some groups doing this work.*\n - *Donate against vulnerable red Senate seats.*\n\nNow is the time for We the People to rise up and come to the defense of our democracy.

Not just our pandemic response or racial justice, but our democracy itself.”\n\nI know why Obama was laying low for a while the last few years, but I’m glad he’s become more visible & vocal during this stretch of the campaign. And, I couldn’t think of a better way to do it than by raising awareness about the importance of voting and the issues impacting everyone. When he talks, people listen. And, right now, it’s very effective!"

Also at one point I lived in a military brain injury center for two months and was treated all day in neurology, vestibular, OT, speech, PT, opthimology, audiology, psychology, and psychiatry. I still have to take other brain meds daily. My neurologist is on speed dial and I qualified for the Wounded Warrior program. \n\nI can ace the MOCA.\n\nEdit:  I wanna hijack my own top comment on here because I just got out of therapy with my psychologist. Having cognitive issues does not mean you’re *dumb*. Ivy League valedictorians can still get dementia, other disease, or injury. \n\nThe slap in the face of being defyingly impugnment that you’re intelligent because you passed one of these tests, to the point of challenging others to take it and compare, while *totally disregarding why one was administered in the first place*, is beyond insulting. \n\n**tl;dr**:  I’m not dumb because I have a brain disease.

You will likely speak to an intern, so keep it nice and concise.\n\n2. Tell them your full name, address, and phone number. This lets them know you are a voter in their state.\n\n3. Have a short script prepared so you hit all the main points. For example:\n\n> Hi, my name is [say your name] and I live in [your city, state]. I'm calling to urge Senator [name] to return from recess to pass the stimulus bill, with election funding and funding for the USPS. It is so important that our elections are secure and trusted this fall, and the only way that will happen is if states have enough funding and the USPS can operate efficiently.\n\n> Senator [name] can reach me at [your phone number].\n\n> Thank you!\n\nMost Senators will have a website with the contact details for their state offices. Call between 9-5pm and leave a message if no one answers.\n\nSeriously, these phone calls make a huge impact. Please call!"

Except they don’t know it’s a joke.\n\nEDIT: When the president touted a chemical as a miracle cure people went out and tried to get it prescribed. Cholorquine can be a very dangerous drug if not taken exactly as prescribed by a physician. Any overdose can be toxic and potentially fatal. When people were told by their doctors that they wouldn't prescribe it to them, I can only imagine people turned to the internet and found Chloroquine Phosphate.\n\nNow yes I know everything is back ordered on Amazon now, I saw some things available still, maybe what I consider essential and Amazon sees as essential differ somewhat, but I get it. The above was kind of a joke, but just so we're clear, don't consume chemicals under the auspices of medical necessity unless prescribed by a fucking doctor... ok?"

Him. Personally. He has no means of repaying them. He already refinanced his few profitable properties, and sold off most of his stocks to stay afloat. He appears short on liquidity. And we still don’t know to whom he owes the money.\n>\n>This fact has frightening implications for public policy and national security. Even minor debts are a frequent reason for the government to deny a security clearance, for the obvious reason that indebted and financially desperate public servants make easy marks for bribery, blackmail and potential treason. The potentially destructive power of that sort of hold on a President of the United States is beyond comprehension. It is the stuff of nightmares, bad spy movie plots and otherwise outlandish conspiracy theory. Imagine if a president owed millions to the mob or to those with close ties to a foreign government, and those individuals both controlled the president’s financial future and knew of corrupt criminal activity. The president might act with otherwise strange deference to said mobsters and those connected to them, and bend public policy on their behalf. If they were tied to fossil fuel interests, the president might set the globe on fire rather than cross them. If his creditors were simply a wealthy set of Wall Street tycoons, he might rig all financial policy on their direct behalf.\n>\n>What we do know is that beginning in the late 2000s, no one would lend to Donald Trump. His history of bankruptcies, combined with whatever horrors were on his personal and organizational financial statements, clearly made every bank run the other direction. Every bank but one, that is: Deutsche Bank. Donald Trump’s history with Deutsche Bank has always merited special scrutiny, but never more than now. The head honchos at Deutsche would have known just how desperate Trump’s financial position was. But they lent to him anyway. Why? It certainly looks even more ominous that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s son was managing the real estate division at Deutsche that lent to Trump, and that Justice Kennedy unexpectedly retired to ensure Trump could seat his replacement. And it looks triply suspicious that Deutsche Bank has been fined and sanctioned over multiple money laundering scandals, including $20 billion from Russian kleptocrats."

I was the son of a single mom and learned to read from comic books. My grandparents helped raise me. They didn’t have a lot, but they taught me the important stuff: that hard work and character, matter.\n\nI earned a scholarship to Yale University, and eventually Georgetown Law. I came back to South Carolina to teach 9th grade social studies before I went to work for Congressman Jim Clyburn. During my time in his office, I was the first African-American Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus and Floor Manager for the House Majority Whip, which Rep. Clyburn became when the Democrats took control of the House in 2006.\n\nI served as the first African-American Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party before deciding to run for Senate. My most important job, though, is that I’m now raising my two boys with my wife, Marie, in Columbia, SC. \n\nThe American Dream is alive and well for some, but not all Americans. Here in South Carolina, rural hospitals are closing, schools are underfunded, roads are crumbling, and our coasts are threatened by offshore drilling. We need a Senator who’s fighting to improve the lives of South Carolinians rather than focusing on interests in Washington D.C.\n\nI’m running for Senate to fight for opportunity for all South Carolinians. I know that when your community needs help, political party affiliations don’t matter.\n\nAsk me anything about my campaign, how Lindsey Graham has forgotten the people of South Carolina and our country, or baking (one of my favorite hobbies, especially during quarantine)! I'll be on around 3 PM EST to answer your questions.\n\nProof:  https://i.redd.it/36idpf4877051.jpg\n\nEDIT: This was a lot of fun, y’all! Thanks for the great questions. Definitely follow us on social media and check out our website to sign up for updates on the race - jaimeharrison.com. I truly believe that we not only have a shot at this, but that we are going to beat Lindsey and bring back common sense and decency to the Senate. Have a great day and a great Memorial Day weekend, y’all! Live long and prosper!",

These changes compound the operational and service delays that you have instituted.\n\n>During our meeting with Leader Schumer on August 5, you committed to greater transparency and accountability with the Congress and the American people regarding the changes that you have made, which directly reach into the lives of the American people.  We remind you of your pledge to provide documentation of the operational changes that you have and are currently making, and of the Postal Service’s plan to successfully deliver election mail during the 2020 elections. \n\n>The Postal Service motto states, “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.”  Let us keep the promise provided for in the Constitution to the American people.\n\n>We await your swift reply."

Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) attempted to broker a deal for a pardon or clemency between the White House and Assange.\n\nNow Assange is alleging the \"deal\" was a quid pro quo **to exonerate Russia for 2016.**\n\nTrump's impeachment focused on Trump using military aid (specifically, Javelin missiles) to extort Ukraine into rigging the 2020 election by investigating the Bidens. However, in [he transcript his initial focus](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf) was on **extorting Ukraine into exonerating Russia for 2016:**\n\n> *Zelensky:* I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\n>\n> *Trump:* I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. **I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike**... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... **The server, they say Ukraine has it.** There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people.\n\nThis exchange was a reference to a [fairly insane conspiracy theory](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-seized-conspiracy-theory-called-insurance-policy-now-it-s-n1062096), emanating from and enhanced by Russian propaganda efforts, to claim that Ukraine was actually responsible for 2016 election interference and that the DNC framed Russia.\n\nAs far as where Trump got his marching orders, it would appear that happened [in his meeting with Putin in Helsinki](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-crowdstrike-ukraine-server-conspiracy-theory-60-minutes-2020-02-16/) where he famously [sided with Putin over his intelligence services](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812).\n\n>**\"Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server?** And what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question,\" Mr Trump said in a press conference while standing alongside President Putin. \"My people came to me — Dan Coats came to me and some others — they said they think it's Russia. **I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server.\"**\n\nIf Assange is telling the truth, this effort extends back a year earlier, and begin with an offer to enlist Assange personally into the conspiracy."

Okay? Do it.\"**\n>\n>On the recording, it appears the two Giuliani associates are telling President Trump that the U.S. ambassador has been bad-mouthing him, which leads directly to the apparent remarks by the President. The recording was made by Fruman according to sources familiar with the tape.\n\nAnd there it is, the consummation of a **a criminal conspiracy currently under federal indictment** in the Southern District of New York, personally directed by Donald Trump: an exchange of public announcements by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General (Yuriy Lutsenko) which would help rig the 2020 US election for Trump in exchange for firing the US Ambassador to Ukraine (Maria Yovanovich). \n\nThis is a bit confusing, because this conspiracy *predates* Trump's direct extortion of President Zelensky. Here is a summary:\n\n - The [SDNY indictment of Parnas](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/lev-parnas-and-igor-fruman-charged-conspiring-violate-straw-and-foreign-donor-bans) explicitly describes [the conspiracy with Lutsenko](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/lutsenko-unnamed-ukrainian-who-led-plot-oust-yovanovitch-says-official-n1065246), at the time the corrupt prosecutor general of Ukraine, as a core subject of the indictment:\n \n>\"They sought political influence not only to advance their own financial interests, but **to advance the political interests** of at least one foreign official ⁠— **a Ukrainian government official** [Lutsenko] who sought the dismissal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,\" Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a Thursday news conference.\n\n -  Recently revealed text messages between Parnas and Lutsenko yielded [the most conclusive evidence yet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ukraine-prosecutor-offered-information-related-to-biden-in-exchange-for-ambassadors-ouster-newly-released-materials-show/2020/01/14/cc45d19e-371e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html) that Lutsenko was specifically offering to fabricate claims about the Bidens in exchange for Yovanovich's termination.\n\n>The messages, written in Russian, show Lutsenko urging Parnas to force out Yovanovitch in exchange for cooperation regarding Biden. At one point, Lutsenko suggests he won’t make any helpful public statements unless “madam” is removed.\n>\n>“It’s just that **if you don’t make a decision about Madam — you are calling into question all my declarations. Including about B**,” Lutsenko wrote to Parnas in a March 22 message on WhatsApp.\n\n - As [WSJ reported in October](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-ordered-ukraine-ambassador-removed-after-complaints-from-giuliani-others-11570137147), and which is now supported by a smoking gun audio recording, Yovanovitch's removal was **personally ordered by Donald Trump**, consummating the conspiracy.\n\n - This scheme fell apart when Vlodimir Zelenskiy was elected President running on an anti-corruption platfrom, and terminated Lutsenko, who [then became the subject of investigation](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-ex-prosecutor-lutsenko-probed-for-abuse-of-power/30220338.html) for abuse of power.\n\n - In the infamous phone call, Trump [specifically berated Zelenskiy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-obsession.html) for Lutsenko's termination:\n \n>“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky, in what people familiar with the conversation said was a reference to Mr. Lutsenko.\n>\n>“A lot of people are talking about that, the way **they shut your very good prosecutor down,” Mr. Trump said**, later adding that Mr. Lutsenko “was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor.” \n\n - In the same phone call, he also [explicitly referenced Yovanovitch's removal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/yovanovitch-trump-ukraine-ambassador.html) and his displeasure with her.\n\n>In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump, he told Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, that she was “bad news.”\n>\n>**“She’s going to go through some things,”** he added.\n\n - We learned last week that the \"things\" Yovanovich was going through included extra-legal [surveillance by Parnas or his associates](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1217215352754577409), and discussion of paying entities within Ukraine to coerce, and potentially commit violence against, Yovanovich.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that Trump was personally aware of everything that was going on, as was asserted in [a letter revealed last week](https://twitter.com/jamiedupree/status/1217225783460143111), from Rudy Giuliani to Vlodomir Zelensky when all of this was beginning, that everything they were doing was **with the explicit \"knowledge and consent\" of Donald Trump.**"

Is it in the back office of the rural hospitals, or maybe it’s in the tents were setting up to take our overflow. Because that’s everyone’s dream right?

Maybe the baby faced 18 year old National Guard member, who never signed up for this shit and who isn’t getting any psychological counseling when it’s over, maybe he has it?\n\nOh wait maybe they sent it to my house? The house that I have to strip naked before entering so I don’t infect my kids. Maybe it’s there. God knows, I wouldn’t know, because I live in hotels and call rooms. I’ve lived in them for the last 6 months as we’re “turning the corner” over and over and just spinning in circles like a maladjusted psychotic dog that no one has the balls to just put out of its misery\n\nMaybe it’s in a refrigerated truck. Is that where your keeping the money? I know that’s where we’re keeping the bodies. The bodies of the people I just happened to diagnose with Covid so I can make a couple extra bucks. Because, yeah, that what I’m doing with my life. That’s why I learned all this stupid medicine and science. That’s why I dedicated my life to trying to save people while you peddle bullshit in a mass super spreader event you call a political rally. For the money.\n\nSo where the fuck is it?"

The CIA kidnapped people off the street and have them insanely high doses of LSD and made them mind control research participants against their will. We waged a fundamentally immoral war where around 2 million civilians died. We spied on, wages psychological war and occasionally killed US citizens who fought against the status quo. These aren’t exceptions - they were the rule. \n\nA major difference between then and now is that then labor was actually strong in the US. So the “them” that we could be criminal against was black people in Alabama, college students and prisoners, people in other countries and dissidents but your W2 factory worker had it okay (good benefits, pension, rising wages) and the government didn’t fuck with him.\n\nNow we live in a globalized world and labor is weak (basically all gains to the economy since Reagan have gone to capital and labor has not gotten any of the growth). If you’re a W2 worker now you get the same treatment as a “them”. You’re no different to the system than someone in India or China who makes a dollar an hour or a black person in Alabama or a civilian in Vietnam.\n\nSo I don’t know. America never really gave a shit about lots of people’s lives - they just don’t give a shit about a bigger percentage now is the only change I see."

Bannon is currently being charged. Trump's 2016 campaign was a criminal enterprise.  That has been proven in court! The only reason Trump hasn't been arrested **yet** is because he's the President."

Nor did a separate national testing plan—organized by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner—which was supposed to be presented for Trump’s approval but, for unknown reasons, was never announced.\n\nVanity Fair: [How Jared Kushner’s Secret Testing Plan “Went Poof Into Thin Air”](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/07/how-jared-kushners-secret-testing-plan-went-poof-into-thin-air)\n\n>Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert."

But he squeezed the budget for pandemics, disbanded the federal team in charge of protecting the country from biological threats, and stripped down the Beijing office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n2.\n\n> In early February, trade adviser Peter Navarro, biomedical research director Rick Bright, and other officials warned of impending shortages of these supplies. Azar would later claim that during this time, everyone in the administration was pleading for more equipment. But when Azar requested $4 billion to stock up, the White House refused. Trump dismissed the outcry for masks and ridiculed Democrats for “forcing money” on him to buy supplies. “They say, ‘Oh, he should do more,’ ” the president scoffed in an interview on Feb. 28. “There’s nothing more you can do.”\n\n3.\n\n> trump didn’t just ignore warnings. He suppressed them.\n\n4.\n\n> In the three weeks after his Feb. 26 crackdown on his subordinates, Trump opposed or obstructed every response to the crisis.\n\n5 . \n\n> The president’s most decisive contribution to the death toll was his resistance to public health measures known as “mitigation”: social distancing, school and workplace closures, and cancellations of large gatherings. Messonnier and others had warned since early February that Americans needed to prepare for such measures. On Feb. 24, Trump’s health advisers decided it was time to act. But they couldn’t get a meeting with Trump, because he was off to India to discuss another trade deal. When he returned, he blew up at Messonnier for talking about closing schools and offices. The meeting to discuss mitigation was canceled.\n\n6.\n\n> Fauci, Birx, Redfield, and other health officials pointed out that mitigation was working. They argued against premature resumption of in-person social activities, noting that the virus wasn’t under control and might roar back. Trump publicly overruled them, tried to discredit them, and pressured them to disavow their words. To block Fauci from disputing Trump’s assurances that the virus was “going away,” the White House barred him from doing most TV interviews.\n\nAnd now we have at least 5 million Americans infected from this and well over 150,000 dead."

Romney finished speaking](https://twitter.com/EamonJavers/status/1225136425194205184), the White House announced that reporters will now no longer be invited to the Oval Office for the pool spray that was scheduled at 2:15 pm. Reporters were already on the South Lawn and ready to go in when the WH cancelled it.\n\nSounds like someone is having a massive meltdown right now.\n\nEdit: Should add that not only did Mitt tell his reasoning to the Atlantic to publish when he started talking, but he did the same for Fox's Chris Wallace... and guessing from above Fox didn't leak this to Trump before hand."

I extended my warm congratulations and thanked him for the patriotic message he delivered last night. I also called Kamala Harris to congratulate her on her historic election to the vice presidency. Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country. The President-elect reiterated that while he ran as a Democrat, he will govern for all Americans. I offered him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and Obama: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can.** I want to congratulate President Trump and his supporters on a hard-fought campaign. He earned the votes of more than 70 million Americans – an extraordinary political achievement. They have spoken, and their voices will continue to be heard through elected Republicans at every level of government.   The fact that so many of our fellow citizens participated in this election is a positive sign of the health of our democracy and a reminder to the world of its strength. **No matter how you voted, your vote counted.** President Trump has the right to request recounts and pursue legal challenges, and any unresolved issues will be properly adjudicated. **The American people can have confidence that this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.  The challenges that face our country will demand the best of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris – and the best of us all.  We must come together for the sake of our families and neighbors, and for our nation and its future. There is no problem that will not yield to the gathered will of a free people.** Laura and I pray for our leaders and their families. We ask for God’s continued blessings on our country. And we urge all Americans to join us in wishing our next President and Vice President well as they prepare to take up their important duties.”"

                    "text": "1. Jane Doe age 13: \"Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump's sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.\"\n\nShe was just 13 years old. \n\n2. Ivana Trump: In his ex-wife's book she details how he pulled out her hair and then raped her for referring the surgeon that did his scalp reduction surgery. He cheated on this wife with wife #2 Marla Maples. He then cheated on Marla with Melania. And yep, cheated on Melania while she was pregnant with a porn star. All three are held bound by NDA's. \n\n3. Amy Dorris: Dorris alleged that Trump assaulted her when she went to the bathroom.\n“He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off,” she said. “And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything.”\n\n4. Karen Johnson: Johnson alleged that Trump grabbed her vagina without her consent and forcibly kissed her at a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s. “When he says that thing, ‘Grab them in the pussy,’ that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that’s where he grabbed me ― he grabbed me there in my front and pulled me in.”\n\n5. E. Jean Carroll: “The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,” she wrote. Trump then held her against a wall and began pulling down her tights. The next moment, still wearing correct business attire, shirt, tie, suit jacket, overcoat, he opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway — or completely, I’m not certain — inside me.”\n\n6. Alva Johnson: The president kissed her without her consent outside of a rally in Florida on August 24, 2016. “I immediately felt violated because I wasn’t expecting it or wanting it, I can still see his lips coming straight for my face.” She said she turned her face away from Trump’s kiss, which landed on the side of her mouth, telling the Post that it felt “super-creepy and inappropriate.”\n\n7. Ninni Laaksonen: Trump groped her in July 2006 while she was in New York competing in the Miss Universe pageant. She says the incident occurred right before she and three other contestants, along with Trump, appeared on the “Late Show with David Letterman.” “Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt,” she told Ilta-Sanomat. “He really grabbed my butt. I don’t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: ‘What is happening?’” Laaksonen also says that at a party she attended during that time, she was told by another guest that Trump liked her “because [she] looked like Melania when she was younger.”\n\n8. Jessica Drake: Trump grabbed her, kissed her without her consent and offered her $10,000 to have sex with him at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament.\n\n9. Karena Virginia: Trump groped her while she was leaving the US Open in 1998. She said that she was waiting for a car to take her home when Trump approached her with a group of a few other men. According to Virginia he said, “Hey look at this one!” and “Look at those legs.” Virginia alleged that he then grabbed her right arm with his right arm, then touched the inside of her right breast before reportedly asking, “Don’t you know who I am?” Virginia said that her shock soon turned to shame and that she changed the way she dressed as a result of the encounter, hoping to avoid unwanted male attention. She was 27 at the time.\n\n10. Cathy Heller: “He grabbed her, went for a kiss, and grew angry with her as she twisted away.” This was all while Heller was having Mother’s Day brunch at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, in-laws and children. Trump said, “Oh, come on” when she protested and held her still while he kissed her on the side of the mouth before walking away. A relative who was seated at the table that day that Trump was “very forceful” and got “in her face.”\n\n11. Summer Zervos: Trump assaulted her on several occasions. She said the first time, she met with Trump in his office and he kissed her on the mouth, which Zervos rationalized as simply a strange greeting. On a separate occasion, she said she met with Trump at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss business opportunities. Instead Trump grabbed her while she sat next to him and began kissing her and touching her breasts, Zervos said in her statement. Trump later walked her into the bedroom, she told reporters, and “began thrusting his genitals.” The two did go on to have dinner and discuss real estate, according to Zervos. When asked why she chose to come forward now, she said: “I want to be able to sleep when I’m 70.”\n\n12. Kristin Anderson: Trump reach into her skirt and touch her vagina through her underwear.\n\n13. Samantha Holvey: She was competing in the 2006 Miss USA pageant, Trump inspected each contestant before the pageant. “He would step in front of each girl and look you over from head to toe like we were just meat, we were just sexual objects, that we were not people. You know when a gross guy at the bar is checking you out? It’s that feeling,” she told CNN, adding that it was the “the dirtiest I felt in my entire life.”\n\n14. Lisa Boyne: Trump did not pursue her sexually, but asked her opinion on who at the table he should sleep with.\n\n15. Jessica Leeds: She and Trump spoke for a bit, then about 45 minutes into the flight he lifted the armrest between them and began to grab her breasts and put his hand up her skirt. “He was like an octopus. His hands were everywhere.”\n\n16. Rachel Crooks: She introduced herself and shook his hand, but he would not let go. Trump began to kiss her on the cheeks, then directly on the mouth. “It was so inappropriate. I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.” Crooks was 22 at the time.\n\n17. Mindy McGillivray: Trump groped her while she was attending a concert at Mar-a-Lago. “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald. This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab. It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.”\n\n18. Natasha Stoynoff: Trump assaulted her while she was interviewing him and his wife, Melania, at their Palm Beach estate. Trump insisted on giving her a private tour of the grounds, at which point he pinned and kissed her: “Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat ... I was grateful when Trump’s longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.”\n\n19. Jennifer Murphy: Trump kissed her on the lips after a job interview. “He walked me to the elevator, and I said goodbye. ... When he pulled my face in and gave me a smooch. I was like ‘OK,' I didn’t know how to act.”\n\n20. Mariah Billado: Miss Teen USA contestant - Trump walked into the changing room while the contestants were half-dressed. “I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here’” She remembered Trump responding: “Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.”\n\n21. Tasha Dixon: When she was 18 and competing in a Miss Universe pageant, Trump walked into the changing room while the participants were changing. “Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis,” Dixon said. “He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\n22. Cassandra Searles: “Do y’all remember that one time we had to do our onstage introductions, but this one guy treated us like cattle and made us do it again because we didn’t look him in the eyes? Do you also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he could get a closer look at his property? He probably doesn’t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”\n\n23. Bridget Sullivan: Trump would hug her and give her “a squeeze that your creepy uncle would.” She added that before the Miss Universe contest in 2000, Trump came backstage to wish all of the contestants good luck. “The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking,” she said. “We were all naked.”\n\n24. Temple Taggart McDowell: “He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, ‘Oh my God, gross.’ He was married to Marla Maples at the time … I was like ‘Wow, that’s inappropriate.’”\n\n25. Jill Harth: Harth alleged in court documents that Trump repeatedly sexually harassed her, at one point groping her under the table. “How can people not believe me now?” after footage of Trump emerged in which he said he can grab women by the pussy.\n\nEdit: \nAdded Sources: 1. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-running-list-of-the-women-whove-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-misconduct_n_57ffae1fe4b0162c043a7212\n2. https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Johnson_TrumpEpstein_Lawsuit.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2QUiAheqQoHTQz63aIpeecNjNIJpt8h5nFXAIzm2hvIReYIvQAQ7A6U50"

Oh, right; because Trump--enabled by his Republican loyalists--has continually broken the law and violated the Constitution by not divesting upon taking office.  It is \"historic\" because of the blatant and unprecedented corruption.  \n\nPut another way, we've never had a President with such bad credit that only foreign, government owned banks would lend to that person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the 2012 Bank of China deal also stands out because Trump and his campaign have repeatedly highlighted the same bank's role in a $1.5 billion deal announced in 2013 by partners of Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. \n\nClassic Republican projection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Critics of the Bidens have seized on the fact that the agreement materialized just days after Hunter Biden traveled to China with the then-vice president, who was there on official business.  \n>  \n>“Why did the Chinese government's bank want to do business with Hunter Biden while his dad was Vice President,” Trump’s campaign asked on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1248627139420790784) earlier this month. The issue was also raised in a[ campaign ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv7yVCwv6NU&feature=youtu.be) the day before, one in a stream of criticisms about the China deal raised by campaign spokespeople and Trump since last year.\n\nI don't know--why did they lend to a U.S. citizen unable to secure any lending outside of Russia's state bank? Why did they grant Trump and his daughter highly sought after trademarks for all manner of products after Trump met privately with Chinese leadership?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Trump campaign has steadily increased its focus on trying to portray Biden as weak on China amid rising voter disapproval of China, the source of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump surrogate Corey Lewandowski dubbed him “Beijing Biden” in an online campaign event Wednesday. And during a White House press briefing Saturday, Trump said China will “own” the U.S. if Biden wins.\n\nCorey Lewandowski found a moment of his precious time that would otherwise be spent assaulting\\[[1](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/27/ex-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-accused-of-sexual-assault)\\] women\\[[2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/video-shows-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-grabbing-michelle-fields/2016/03/29/8b53c8a4-f5c2-11e5-958d-d038dac6e718_video.html)\\] and talking with the police, to pilot test a nickname for his boss.\n\nThis type of person would seriously be a scandal unto itself in any Democratic administration. What's next? We going to wait for Rob Porter to wipe his wife's *and* his mistress' blood off his bruised knuckles before getting his hot take as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But Trump’s recent criticisms of China have been muddied by his own [mixed messaging](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/trump-china-coronavirus-148806) as well as by his numerous financial ties to the country. Those connections extend far beyond the Avenue of the America’s loan: Chinese state-owned companies are constructing two luxury Trump developments in [United Arab Emirates](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article172443417.html) and [Indonesia](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/01/trump-resort-south-korea-government-1390736). The president and his daughter Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser, have been awarded trademarks by China’s government. And his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has courted Chinese investors in at least [one other](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-business.html?module=inline) real estate deal.  \n>  \n>“We actually explored all these foreign enterprises and how once he became president he’d be seen differently by foreign leaders who would have leverage over this president because he had investments in their countries and/or financial dealings with business enterprises and financial institutions and investors in their countries,” said **Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight Committee. “He is highly conflicted with respect to China.”**\n\nGerry Connolly should not be making statements if this is the best he has for such a serious situation.  Democrats need to put their most assertive figures in charge of messaging.  People don't care if they hear he is highly conflicted with respect to China.  They've heard that song and dance for almost 4 years now, in addition to other countries.  They need to just say what we all know in order to keep in the forefront of people's minds: **Trump and his family members who are appointed jobs owes China money** ***and*** **favors**. That comes due starting next year. Are your kids' future worth sacrificing at the altar of a supreme malignant narcissist?"

Trump’s people have neither proven it nor have tried; legally, Biden certainly does not have to prove it. In normal litigation, the only burden borne by an adverse party — generally speaking — is to assert affirmative defenses or to present counterclaims or crossclaims.\n\nTrump’s got no cards left to play, so he’s resorted to this “burden-shifting” crap. I guess we shouldn’t be surprised. When you go 1-38 in court with the burden of proof on your side, it seems likely you might want to try a different approach. And, so...here we are. 😒🙄🤦🏽‍♂️"

Homeless outreach, armed response, traffic enforcement, domestic disturbances are all responsibilities that should be given to the correct sectors and the appropriate budget.\n\n2. [End qualified immunity like Colorado](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2020/06/21/colorado-passes-landmark-law-against-qualified-immunity-creates-new-way-to-protect-civil-rights/#3bfface6378a) -  Which is what practically prevents citizens from being able to sue officers for neglect and misconduct.\n\n3. [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision) - A lot of relatively easy (compared to structural changes like #1 or #2) to implement improvements that would increase public trust and officer safety.\n\n***\n\n#The Progress\n\nResolution to Portland Charter adding [Community Police Oversight Board](https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2020/07/29/hardesty-and-wheeler-declare-truce-send-portland-voters-a-proposal-for-police-reform/) will be on November ballot."

The judge’s order came after the agency disclosed that more than 300,000 ballots nationwide could not be traced.\n> Follow the latest on Election 2020\n> \n> U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia had given the mail agency until 3:30 p.m. to conduct the “all clear” checks to ensure there would be enough time to get any found ballots to election officials before polls closed. His order affected 12 postal districts spanning 15 states.\n> \n> But in a filing sent to the court just before 5 p.m., Justice Department attorneys representing the Postal Service said the agency would not abide by the order to better accommodate inspector’s schedules.\n> \n> “This daily review process, however, occurs at different times every day,” DOJ attorney John Robinson wrote. “Specifically, on Election Night, it is scheduled to occur from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., a time period developed by Postal Service Management and the Postal Inspection Service in order to ensure that Inspectors are on site to ensure compliance at the critical period before the polls close. Given the time constraints set by this Court’s order, and the fact that Postal Inspectors operate on a nationwide basis, Defendants were unable to accelerate the daily review process to run from 12:30pm to 3:00pm without significantly disrupting preexisting activities on the day of the Election, something which Defendants did not understand the Court to invite or require.”\n> \n> Sullivan’s order came after the agency disclosed that 300,523 ballots nationwide received scanned that indicated they had entered postal processing plants, but had not received exit scans, leaving voting rights advocates worried that hundreds of thousands of votes could be trapped in the mail system on the eve of the election.\n> \n> The NAACP, which brought the lawsuit against the Postal Service with a group of voters and other civil rights groups, asked Sullivan for an emergency hearing to discuss the inspection schedules.\n> \n> “This is super frustrating,” NAACP attorney Allison Zieve said. “If they get all the sweeps done today in time, it doesn’t matter if they flouted the judge’s order. They say here they will get the sweeps done between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., but 8 p.m. is too late, and in some states, 5 p.m. is too late.”"

They fill out the ballot and mail it back, but by the time it finally makes its way to their local officials, Election Day has passed and their votes don’t count.\n\n> That’s because — and this is vital to understand — in 34 states, including the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, ballots can’t just be postmarked by Election Day to count. It has to be received by Election Day. If you mail it three days before, thinking you did everything right, but it doesn’t arrive at the board of elections until the day after the election, it’s tossed in the trash.\n\n> This has all the makings of an election nightmare purposefully engineered by Trump and DeJoy. As they know full well, due to Trump’s relentless campaign to convince people that mail voting is inherently fraudulent (unless Republicans are doing it), Democrats are now far more likely to say they’re going to vote by mail.\n\n> **This is election theft in progress. And as awful as that is, it’s made even more despicable by the fact that to rig the election, Trump is trying to murder a national treasure.**"

We are deemed essential and while we have cut hours for some employees to reduce the risk of spread we have not reduced salary/pay due the financial hardship it will cause. \n\nWe filed for PPP on the morning Applications could first be submitted, we kept up with Bank of America's ever changing document requirements. We were assured that loans would be distributed in the order the applications were received. \n\nToday we had a meeting with our banker and were informed that there is no money left in the fund. When we asked for an explanation why we didn't receive funding despite filing very early, our banker couldn't give us any explanation. To compound matters further,  she told us Bank of America   could not extend private line of credit due to the uncertainty caused by Covid-19. \n\nNow I'm reading about the class action lawsuits being filed against the lenders. Apparently, banks reshuffled the Applications prioritizing businesses who were to receive the largest loans because the larger the loan, the more money the bank makes off the processing fees. \n\nSource: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/20/small-businesses-sue-chase-bank-over-handling-stimulus/5163654002/\n\nI'm afraid that we are gonna have to start laying off people I've known for 20 years, people who are more like family members than co-workers. The issue is bigger than what businesses qualify for PPP, the banks are fucking small business owners.\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you everybody for the well wishes and the advice, I really appreciate it, I did not think I would illicit this type of response. For those who are curious what we do, we run a small boutique law office (8 employees) representing injured workers in their workers compensation claims, definitely not the most lucrative or sexy field of law but the payoff is helping people. For those who have never been involved with a workers compensation, its a really screwed up system.  We essentially try to get injured workers the best healthcare available, deal with insurance companies to ensure that the injured worker gets disability benefits if they cannot work because of their injury and also ensure injured workers get the permanent disability they should be entitled to if they lose some ability to compete in their individual labor market.\n\nFor you healthcare and supermarket workers out there putting yourselves in harms way for the rest of us, while our states Labor Code may be in for some change as a result of Covid-19, I would be more than happy let you know how Covid-19 works within our workers compensation system and the benefits you should be entitled to."

People refusing to wear masks, even though my restaurant has a strict mask only policy. People tipping like trash because they can’t come in without a mask. And now with the contact tracing over the past two weeks.. people have told me to fuck off, called Whitmer “Governor Hilter”, written down her husbands name and phone number for contact tracing.. the list goes on and on. Election Day was probably my worst day as a server, ever. I had at least three tables (older white men) ask me who I voted for, when I refused to answer because I explained it was unprofessional for me to discuss politics, they said, “Well based on the color of your skin, you’re probably thrilled with what Trump has done for our country!”. At first I was confused, then I realized they probably thought I was Latina as I have dark features and olive skin (I am Greek). I had a table of four old people literally cheers to “Trump” and “down with the dems!” as I was serving them coffee.. then they refused to give me a first name and phone number for contact tracing. The majority of people that have treated me like shit are old, white people who would more than likely die if they get covid, but they can’t resist a two egg fucking breakfast and coffee special. The way Whitmer has been treated makes absolutely no sense to me. She is doing everything she should be doing. And by the way, this latest 3 week shut down was established by the Department of Health and Human Services because Republican legislators just had to go to the Supreme Court of Michigan to take away any powers she had to protect Michigan. As a server, I am happy for this shut down. Will I have no income for three weeks? Yup. Has unemployment completely fucked people who lost a majority of their work hours? Yup. But I am sick and tired of being thrown to the wolves and having my health put at risk so some 70 year old morons can have some breakfast and coffee instead staying the fuck home. I hope people actually listen this time, because shit is getting bad in Michigan. I am thankful for my governor, and she is trying her best to get Michigan back on track. \n\nSorry for ranting I am just so fucking fed up.\n\nEDIT: I am so overwhelmed by the outpouring of love I have received in the past hour from all of you. I made this comment to just scream into the void that is reddit and the fact that all of you took the time to read my comment and empathize with me means so much. You guys have made my day. Thank you.\n\nEDIT 2: I also quickly want to acknowledge a few comments telling me to get a better career or to go to college. First point, serving is a career. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a lifelong server. When the globe isn’t in a pandemic, it’s normally a great way to make a living. Second point, I am in college because I personally do not want to be a lifelong server. And that’s okay, too."

At that point Graham publicly supported Trump.   \n\nWhy do we have a senate foreign relations committee if it’s just to advise, not check, a rogue president?\n\nNow we have heard Trump wants to bomb an Iranian nuclear facility.  Supposedly he’s been talked down from that, but was it by “advisors”? Or elected/appointed government roles stepping in and doing the shit they’re supposed to, to check him?\n\nIf Graham is out doing shady shit directly for Trump - as in election interference - then I doubt he’s being a check/balance.\n\nAre we still at risk of bombing Iran’s nuclear facility, after troop draw downs, right in time to hand a world war to Biden?  \n\nMaybe the golf caddies can let us know."

A little later, Graham realized he had misspoken. He had actually talked to Arizona's governor and some other officials, he said, and he wasn't sure which officials from Nevada had briefed him about that state's 2020 election procedures. Finally, by midafternoon Tuesday, Graham realized he had never spoken to anyone from the Silver State about its 2020 vote.\n\nEvery day I go back and forth from thinking these guys are evil geniuses playing a long game, or just so enveloped in their own arrogance they are destroying themselves in spectacular fashion.

            "selftext": "Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.\n\nThe day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.\n\nDuring the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.\n\nThat intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Report: Intel officials say Russia boosting Trump candidacy](https://apnews.com/4912baca0c4cbc6cb7a3580f4f3c9b96) | apnews.com\n[Intel officials warned House lawmakers Russia is interfering to get Trump reelected: NYT](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/483967-intel-officials-warned-house-lawmakers-russia-is-interfering-to-get) | thehill.com\n[NYT Report: Russia is interfering in the 2020 election, Putin still favors Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/nyt-report-russia-is-interfering-in-the-2020-election-putin-still-favors-trump-79107141982) | msnbc.com\n[Report: Intel officials say Russia boosting Trump candidacy](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/feb/20/report-intel-officials-say-russia-boosting-trump-c/) | lasvegassun.com\n[Trump Replaced Acting DNI with ‘Gold-Level’ Trump Hotel Member After House Was Briefed on Russia Threat: Report](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-replaced-acting-dni-with-gold-level-trump-hotel-member-after-house-was-briefed-on-russia-threat-report/) | lawandcrime.com\n[NYT: Intel officials say Russia interfering in 2020 campaign](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/20/nyt-intel-official-russia-interfere-2020-campaign-election-haberman-blitzer-tsr-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/) | cnn.com\n[Russia Is Helping Elect Trump Again, Intel Official Says](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-is-helping-elect-trump-again-intel-official-says) | thedailybeast.com\n[Russia trying to get Trump re-elected, intelligence officials reportedly tell Congress](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/russia-trump-2020-election-campaign-support-congress-a9348706.html) | independent.co.uk\n[Lawmakers were briefed that Russia is looking to help Trump win in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/politics/trump-russia-intelligence-2020/index.html) | cnn.com\n[Russia is working to get Trump reelected, intelligence officials tell House lawmakers in briefing that angers the president](https://www.courant.com/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-trump-russia-reelection-interference-20200220-ekkyrl57hzfgphvqy35mffoxzi-story.html) | courant.com\n[Trump decided to replace his top spy chief after his aide told Congress that Russia is interfering in 2020 to help Trump win](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-replaced-spy-chief-after-russia-briefing-election-interference-2020-2) | businessinsider.com\n[Trump Soured On Maguire After Staff Told Congress Russia Is Interfering On His Behalf](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-maguire-russia-2020-elections) | talkingpointsmemo.com\n[Russia Backs Trump’s Re-election, and He Fears Democrats Will Exploit Its Support](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html) | nytimes.com\n[Trump sacks director of National Intelligence for 'disloyalty' after he briefed that Russia is working to get their stooge elected again.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/russian-interference-2020-house-warned?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard) | theguardian.com\n[Russia Meddling Again -

Until President Trump nominated her to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, she had never been a judge, never worked in the government as a prosecutor, defense lawyer, solicitor general, or attorney general, or served as counsel to any legislative body—the usual professional channels that Supreme Court nominees tend to hail from. A graduate of Notre Dame law school, Barrett has almost no experience practicing law whatsoever—a hole in her resume so glaring that during her 7th Circuit confirmation hearing in 2017, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were dismayed that she couldn’t recall more than three cases she’d worked on during her brief two years in private practice.

That would obviously be extremely bad under a scenario in which Trump is elected to a second term—as the Washington Post puts it, “think of the Federal Aviation Administration employee evaluating whether an airliner is safe to fly” or “the Food and Drug Administration employee evaluating the efficacy of a vaccine”—and there isn‘t a single person left in the federal government who is qualified or non-corrupt.

In its place, trump has conducted a trade war, imposing billions in tariffs — taxes that are actually paid by Americans — without any concessions from China.\n* **Mr. Trump has treated the COVID-19 global pandemic as a public relations problem instead of working to save American lives.**\n* He lied about the danger of the coronavirus, challenged the expertzs and resisted proactive precautions; now he's trying to force the economy open without bringing the virus under control.\n* As the economy collapsed, he signed an initial round of aid and when the stock market rebounded, even though millions remained out of work, Mr. Trump lost interest.\n* **In September, he declared that the virus “affects virtually nobody” the day before the death toll from the disease in the United States topped 200,000. Nine days later, he caught the virus and received $100,000 in taxpayer funded health care to fight the virus that he did nothing to avoid contracting.**\n* He has pitted Americans against each other, weaponizing Twitter and Facebook to manipulate supporters around a virtual bonfire of grievances to flood the public square with lies, disinformation and propaganda.\n* **At the first presidential debate in September, trump was asked to condemn white supremacists. He responded by instructing the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.”**\n* In June, his administration tear-gassed peaceful protesters from a street in front of the White House so trump could pose with a book he does not read in front of a church he does not attend.\n* trump has repeatedly directed administration officials not to testify before Congress or provide documents, notably including his tax returns.\n* **With the help of AG william barr, he's shielded loyal aides (convicted criminals) from justice.**\n* In May, the Justice Department said it would drop the prosecution of michael flynn even though flynn had [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/michael-flynn-charges-dropped.html) to lying to the F.B.I.\n* In July, trump commuted sentence of former aide, roger stone, who was convicted of obstructing a federal investigation of trump. Senator mitt romney condemned the act as an “unprecedented, historic corruption.”\n* trump pressured the Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, then directed administration to obstruct a congressional inquiry.\n* In December, the House voted to impeach trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. Senate Republicans, excepting Mr. Romney, voted to acquit the president, ignoring his corruption so they could continue to fill the benches of the federal judiciary with [young, conservative lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html).\n* The president votes by mail while saying it's corrupt without proof. His disinformation campaign serves as a rationale for purging voter rolls, closing polling places, tossing absentee ballots and otherwise impeding Americans from exercising their right to vote.\n* **He cannot solve the nation’s pressing problems because he is the nation’s most pressing problem.** \n\nFrederick Douglass lamented during another of the nation’s dark hours, the presidency of Andrew Johnson, “We ought to have our government so shaped that even when in the hands of a bad man, we shall be safe.” But that is not the nature of our democracy. The implicit optimism of American democracy is that the health of the Republic rests on the judgment of the electorate and the integrity of those voters choose.\n\nThe vast amount and variety of trump’s \"misdeeds\" can feel overwhelming. The repetition might have dulled your sense of outrage and it can leave us with little time to focus on the details. **That said, this moment is when Americans must recover their sense of outrage.** Use it to [VOTE and get others to VOTE.](https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/)\n\n(Remix of the NYT opinion piece for easier consumption.

The 25th does not remove the president from office. The president remains the president. The 25th transfers the powers of the president to the VP (who remains the VP, but has the new powers as long as the 25th remains in effect).\n\nGiven that the attempt to impeach the president was blocked by GOP Senators, there is no chance that the 25th would succeed.\n\nEdit: In the last sentence I should have written \"the attempt to remove the president by impeachment was blocked by GOP senators\". The House did impeach him, the GOP blocked the removal."

Here's the article:\n\n**'The president knew everything': Key Trump impeachment figure unexpectedly arrives at Capitol Hill demanding to testify**\n\nRudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas has shown up unexpectedly on Capitol Hill, where he is demanding to meet with senators to tell his side of the impeachment scandal story.\n\nMr Parnas was spotted by reporters as he arrived, and asked what he would tell senators if he were able to get an audience with them.\n\n\"Call the witnesses,\" Mr Parnas responded. \"The president knew everything.\"\n\nHe continued, claiming that there were \"many quid pro quos\" beyond the one apparently highlighted in the 25 July phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in which the American asked for an investigation by the Ukrainian government into a domestic political rival. That phone call sparked a whistle blower complaint, and later the impeachment investigation that has led now to Mr Trump's trial in the Senate.\n\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Mr Parnas, who has been indicted last year on charges of alleged campaign finance violations, could attend the Senate impeachment investigation, but that he would not be allowed to take off his GPS ankle monitor to do so. Because of that, it appears as though he would not be permitted to enter the Senate floor due to the chamber's rules.\n\nThe surprise visit isn't the first time that Mr Parnas has claimed Mr Trump as intimately aware of the scheme that he and Mr Giuliani engaged in to compel a Ukrainian investigation of Joe Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic nominee. And, in addition to Mr Trump, the businessman has claimed that other top level officials including Mike Pence, William Barr and John Bolton were all in the loop on the effort.\n\n\"He lied,\" Mr Parnas said of Mr Trump, when asked during a recent MSNBC interview about the president's claims that he does not know the businessman or his fellow indicted associate, Igor Fruman. \"I mean, we're not friends. ... But he knows exactly who we were. He knows exactly who I was, especially because I interacted with him at a lot of events.\"\n\nThe Capitol Hill visit also comes days after a New York Times report was released detailing claims in an upcoming book by Mr Bolton, who was then the president's national security adviser. In that manuscript, Mr Bolton claims that the president was aware of the efforts to use a White House visit and US military aid to Ukraine as leverage to spark an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nThose claims have led to renewed demands that the Senate impeachment trial call on new witnesses, including Mr Bolton, who has signalled a willingness to testify before the trial should be be subpoenaed.\n\nIn response to those manuscript claims, Mr Giuliani himself has responded, telling CBS News in an interview that Mr Bolton \"never said to me, 'I've got a problem with what you are doing in Ukraine. Never once, never winked, never sent me a little note. He is a personal friend, I thought. So here's the only conclusion I can come to, and it's a harsh one, and I feel very bad about it: \"He's a backstabber.\""

The Constitution protects our everyday life and the continued denigration of it will irreparably shape our country. \n\nWhat happened here was the President using his political power to reduce the sentencing of an individual who not only was a friend, but someone whose criminal conduct directly benefited Donald Trump. Just as the Vindman firings reflect corruption in the way our criminal system looks by discouraging testimony against the executive branch, this sends a clear message: if you stay silent, you will be rewarded. What incentive is there now for a witness to come forward? If they speak, they can be threatened and fired with impunity, sacrificing, in many cases, their entire life’s work.\n\n\nThe message is clear as day. So long as this President is in office, the law and the system that is meant to protect average Americans, will only protect those in power. \n\nVote Blue."

So what happens when a candidate drops out after having won some delegates? This is actually a little murky. Ostensibly, the delegates go to the national convention uncommitted, like superdelegates. There, they should be allowed to vote however they choose.\n\nThese delegates may also be folded into another candidate's delegates. If a candidate drops out of the race, he or she may endorse a rival candidate in the same party. Once this happens, the delegates formerly belonging to the candidate may pledge to the endorsed one.\"\n\n===\n\nEDIT: Thanks to the Redditor who [shared this:](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2020-Delegate-Selection-Rules-12.17.18-FINAL.pdf)\n\n13 states have laws regarding when delegates become uncommitted and allowed to vote their conscience. Iowa and New Hampshire are not part of that group.\n\nRule 13.I and 13.J of the DNC’s Delegate selection rules are all we have to go by outside of those states. The rules are as follows:\n\nRule 13.I “No delegate at any level of the delegate selection process shall be mandated by law or Party rule to vote contrary to that person’s presidential choice as expressed at the time the delegate is elected.”\n\nRule 13.J “Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.”"

A Republican familiar with the meeting was not authorized to describe it by name and requested anonymity.\n\nThe GOP leader faced a handful of potential defections, but several days remained before any potential witness vote would be taken.\n\nA decision to call more witnesses would need 51 votes to pass.

            "selftext": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled federal anti-discrimination protections apply when companies fire people because they are gay or transgender.\n\nAt issue in the dispute is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, among other things, bars discrimination \"because of sex.\" The Supreme Court has applied that prohibition in several other contexts, but Monday marks the first time it has weighed in on whether the protections extend to gay and transgender people.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling comes in a trio of cases the court considered across two hours of oral argument in October.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Supreme Court bans job discrimination against gays, transgender

He said both sides had ample time to reach a deal on outstanding issues before a final vote on Monday. But Democrats unanimously blocked the measure over its provisions allowing the Trump administration to lend hundreds of billions of dollars to major industries like hotels, casinos, cruise lines, and oil and gas.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, said his party opposed moving forward with the bill “because among other problems it includes huge bailouts without protections for people and workers and without accountability, and because it shortchanges our hospitals and health care workers who need our help.”\n\n**Another provision in the bill Democrats oppose would allow Mnuchin to delay publicly releasing the names of businesses that receive a bailout, as well as the amounts of those loans, for six months.**\n\n“We’re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told reporters. “We’re here to help workers, we’re here to help hospitals. And right now what the Republicans proposed does neither of those.” \n\n...\n\nWhy six months of secrecy as to who is getting what? I can surely speculate it is nefarious in nature."

This was much easier.” (Aug 2, 2016)\n\n- Trump attacks Gold Star families: Myeshia Johnson (gold star widow), Khan family (gold star parents) etc. (2016-present)\n\n- Trump sent funds raised from a Jan 2016 veterans benefit to the Donald J Trump Foundation instead of veterans charities (the foundation has since been ordered shut because of fraud) (Jan, 2016)\n\n- Trump said he has \"more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military\" because he went to a military-style academy (2015 biography)\n\n- Trump said he doesn't consider POWs heroes because they were caught. He said he prefers people who were not caught (July 18, 2015)\n\n- Trump said having unprotected sex was his own personal Vietnam (1998)\n\n- For a decade, Trump sought to kick veterans off of Fifth Avenue because he found them unsightly nuisances outside of Trump Tower. 1991\n\n- Trump dodged the draft 5 times by having a doctor diagnose him with bone spurs.\n\n- No Trump in America has *ever* served in the military; this spans 5 generations, and every branch of the family tree. In fact, the reason his grandfather immigrated to America was to avoid military service"

Chadha* (holding legislative vetos unconstitutional)—which states in the relevant part:\n\n>[A]t any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.\n\nIt appears that the House may be setting up a case for litigation, hoping to distinguish *Chadha*, precisely because they want the prohibition to be binding, and know that Donald would simply veto a joint resolution (just as he did with Yemen).\n\nThe argument for distinguishing Chadha would basically be that if Congress cannot disapprove of presidentially-initiated military action *without* the absurd requirement of obtaining presidential assent to disapproval of his own action—or onerous 2/3rds supermajorities in the House and Senate to override a veto—the constitutional power to declare war belongs *de facto* to the president regardless of what Art. I, § 8 Cl. 11 of the Constitution says. If a president engages in war with a flimsy pretext but then  vetos Congressional disapproval attempts, partisanship virtually guarantees that he'll get away with it.\n\nBut the Constitution doesn't say, \"Congress shall have power to *disapprove* war if the president is okay with it.\" Rather, it specifies that the power to declare war belongs to Congress—not the president—*in the first instance*. In other words, prior authorization for war or miliary engagement must be *affirmatively sought* by the president outside of defensive actions against imminent threats.\n\nIt follows that Congress must be able to *withhold* its assent, regardless of whether the president actually seeks it. Otherwise, the requirement for congressional approval would be nullified.\n\nA concurrent resolution expressly withholding Congressional assent is not a legislative act. It is, instead, better understood as formal recognition that the legislative act required to authorize military engagement *has not been undertaken*, and that, therefore, continued military engagement is unconstitutional.\n\nThe War Powers Act merely creates a regular, expedited procedure for doing this."

Bernie Sanders late Tuesday called Betsy DeVos &quot;The worst education secretary in the history of America&quot; and made abundantly clear that he&#039;s not mourning her imminent departure after the billionaire school privatization zealot lashed out at popular proposals to cancel student loan debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.\n\n> &quot;What do you call a billionaire who registered a $40 million, 164-foot yacht in the Cayman Islands to avoid $2.4 million in U.S. taxes, while undermining public schools?

                    "text": "Then there is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), which some have taken to calling \"the most insane law\" ever passed by Congress. The law requires the Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer subsidies, to prefund its retirees' health benefits up to the year 2056. This is a $5 billion per year cost; it is a requirement that no other entity, private or public, has to make. If that doesn't meet the definition of insanity, I don't know what does. Without this obligation, the Post Office actually turns a profit. Some have called this a \"manufactured crisis.\" It's also significant that lots of companies benefit from a burden that makes the USPS less competitive; these same companies might also would benefit from full USPS privatization, a goal that has been pushed by several conservative think tanks for years.\n\nPaying retiree obligations isn't the issue here; rather, being singled out as the only company with a congressional requirement to fully fund those obligations is. It puts the USPS at a huge competitive disadvantage. Yes, a retirement crisis is brewing; most private-sector pensions are wildly underfunded. But the solution is to mandate that ALL companies cover a higher percentage of their future obligations -- not just one entity.\n\nWhat about lobbying Congress for changes to these rules? Unlike private-sector entities, the Postal Service is barred from lobbying. Similar restrictions do not apply to FedEx or UPS or other carriers."
